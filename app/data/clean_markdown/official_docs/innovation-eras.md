## Introduction to Innovation Eras
Xandeum is leading the storage revolution with a path to storage freedom, laid out in 6 Innovation eras.

## Innovation Eras
The 6 Innovation eras are:
* DeepSouth Era
* South Era
* Main Era
* Central Era
* Coal Era
* North Era

## DeepSouth Era
The DeepSouth Era is Xandeum's starting point for building a decentralized storage layer. In this era, the first version of XandMiner, the XandMiner Daemon dubbed XandMinerD will be released, allowing users to:
* create key pairs
* register their pNodes
* create and destroy file systems on their pNode
These basic functions provide everything needed to begin operating a pNode and get a headstart through first mover advantage in the scalable storage layer.

## Xandeum Innovation Era's Milestones
Xandeum is committed to transparency, building in public, and community influenced.
