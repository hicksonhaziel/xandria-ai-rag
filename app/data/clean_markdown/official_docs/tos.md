You agree to indemnify the company from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account on the forum.

## Disclaimers
You accept all risk of using the forum and content on the forum. As far as the law allows, the company and its suppliers provide the forum as is, without any warranty whatsoever.

## Limits on Liability
Neither the company nor its suppliers will be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages their personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms. The total liability to you for claims of any kind that are related to the forum or content on the forum will be limited to $50.

## Feedback
The company welcomes your feedback and suggestions for the forum. You agree that the company will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide, and that the company won’t have to notify you that your feedback was used, get your permission to use it, or pay you.

## Termination
Either you or the company may end the agreement written out in these terms at any time. When our agreement ends, your permission to use the forum also ends.

## Disputes

## General Terms

## Changes
The company may update these terms again. The company will post all updates to the forum. For updates that contain substantial changes, the company agrees to e-mail you, if you’ve created an account and provided a valid e-mail address. Once you get notice of an update to these terms, you must agree to the new terms in order to keep using the forum.
