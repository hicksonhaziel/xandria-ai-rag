## Introduction
We want to give you a clear and complete update so that even if you could not join the recent live session, you have all the important information.

## Partnership with Superteam
We have partnered with Superteam (earn.superteam.fun) to bring more developers to Xandeum and to grow the project faster. Superteam is a well-known platform on Solana that helps projects find talented builders through bounties.

We posted a $5,000 USDC bounty: “Develop an analytics platform for Xandeum P-Nodes”
* 1st place: 2,500 USDC
* 2nd place: 1,500 USDC
* 3rd place: 1,000 USDC

The goal is to create a public website that shows information about all Xandeum P-Nodes (similar to validator dashboards you see on Solana). The winner can run and maintain their own platform and become the main place where people check P-Node stats and decide where to stake.

## Problem with the First Bounty
We launched the bounty as a “Pro” listing because it gives more visibility and reaches Superteam’s most active developers. Unfortunately, the “Pro” mode means only Superteam Pro members can submit. This locked out many loyal Xandeum community members and developers. This was not our intention, and we are truly sorry for the confusion and frustration it caused.

## Our Solution
Right after the live session, we created a second identical bounty that is open to everyone – no Pro membership required.
* Same task
* Same prizes (2,500 / 1,500 / 1,000 USDC)
* Same deadline (around December 25, 2025 – exact date shown on the listing)

This means the total cost for us is now $10,000 USDC instead of $5,000, but it is the right thing to do. No one will be able to win prizes in both bounties – we will check and make sure the prizes go to different people.

You can find both listings at earn.superteam.fun. Look for the Xandeum bounty that does NOT say “Pro only”.

## Why This Bounty Matters
Building a great P-Node analytics platform is more valuable than the prize money itself. The best platform can become the main place where the whole community checks node performance and decides where to stake XAND. The builder can gain respect, attract stake, and grow with the project.

## Mainnet Launch Plan – Still End of 2025
We are working very hard to launch an alpha version on Solana mainnet before the end of 2025. Many new releases are coming in the next days and weeks (0.6, 0.7, 0.8, … up to 1.2). After the alpha launch:
* No data will be lost (we have redundancy and the evict-and-replace system)
* Staking will move from the DAO to real P-Nodes
* Storage rewards will come later when the system is stable

Running a mainnet P-Node will be permissionless. Current Devnet nodes will transition automatically, but you will need a separate VPS for mainnet. We may give small extra rewards (for example an Alpha NFT with staking boost) to early mainnet node operators.

## Airdrop 2 – Coming in a Few Days
The DAO proposal for Airdrop 2 (20 million XAND) passed with strong support. Everything is ready:
* Merkle distributor is built
* Funding is being sent
* Claim page will open again very soon (just a few days)

This airdrop is completely separate from the Superteam bounties (which are paid in USDC).
