## Introduction to Xandeum's pNode Store
Xandeum's pNode Store is live, and it's a game-changer for Web3 storage. The store features 49 Deep South Era pNodes, each offering a 16x era boost for Storage Income (STOINC) and up to an 11x NFT multiplier.

## Why Act Now? Key Benefits for the Community
Getting a pNode during DevNet is crucial for mainnet profitability. Joining now receives support from the Xandeum Foundation, including stake delegation of millions of XAND to your pNode. Deep South pNodes deliver a massive 16x era boost, and combining it with a Titan NFT yields up to 176x overall.

## Munich Release: Powering Web3 Innovation
The Munich release (v0.3) delivered a fully functional pNode prototype for file hosting on Xandeum's storage layer. Built with Xandeum Web3.js, it simplifies development while enabling exabyte-scale storage. The updated XandMiner GUI provides real-time pNode performance stats.

## pNode Store and Dutch Auction: Grab Your Boost
The pNode Store is live at [https://pnodestore.xandeum.network](https://pnodestore.xandeum.network). The Dutch Auction starts on September 6, 2025, with 49 Deep South Era pNodes available. Each pNode has a 16x era boost for STOINC, and early bidders can secure NFTs with multipliers:
* Titan (11x, $4,900 USDC + 490,000 XAND, first two hours)
* Dragon (7x)
* Coyote (2.5x)
* Rabbit (1.5x)
* Cricket (1.1x)

> Note: Prices drop hourly over 48 hours from a high ceiling, creating a high-stakes environment where waiting risks a sell-out.

## Voting on Auction Start Time
Vote on the auction's start time (0:00–23:00 UTC) via the Dutch Decider app before September 5, 2025. Pledge USDC to your preferred hour—the winning time is decided by total pledges.

## Stunning 3D NFTs: A Visual Feast
The Dutch Auction features 3D-rendered NFTs, designed by the marketing team's graphics expert. From the fire-breathing Dragon to the sleek Titan, these NFTs animate in your wallet, adding flair to their STOINC-boosting power.

## Herrenberg and AI Demo App: What's Next
The Herrenberg release will add crude search capabilities to the storage layer, enhancing dApp functionality. The stealth-mode AI demo app focuses on AI accountability and transparency, leveraging Xandeum's unique smart contract-integrated storage.
