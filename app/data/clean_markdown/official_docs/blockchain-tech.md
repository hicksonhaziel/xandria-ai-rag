## Introduction to Xandeum
Xandeum is a community-driven project building a scalable storage layer on Solana.

## Recent Developments
Recent highlights from our founder, Bernie Blume, include:
* Foundation milestones
* Exchange strategies

These developments are important for pNode owners, developers, and those interested in decentralized storage.

## Xandeum pNodes
Xandeum pNodes are the backbone of scalable Solana storage. They use erasure coding to offload data from validators, enabling exabyte-scale dApps.
* Earn ~10,000 XAND monthly on devnet or SOL fees on mainnet
* Easy setup via XandMiner
* Boost Solana’s ecosystem while reaping rewards
