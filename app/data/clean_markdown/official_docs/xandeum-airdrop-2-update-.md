## Xandeum Airdrop 2 Update
Xandeum Airdrop 2 snapshot is done, with a total of approximately 226 million points collected. The team is reviewing for cheating and suspicious allocations will be temporarily held.

## Key Updates
1. **Airdrop 2 Snapshot**: Taken on November 19, 2025
2. **Airdrop 3**: Already live, with a new bonus for joining the official Xandeum Discord
3. **Upcoming DAO Proposal**: For Airdrop 2, with a suggested split of 60 million $XAND into three equal parts
4. **Fairer Distribution**: Using the square-root formula to reward smaller honest participants more fairly
5. **Proposed Vesting Schedule**: 4-month cliff, followed by linear vesting over 12 months

## Upcoming DAO Proposal
The proposed split for Airdrop 2 is:
* 20 million $XAND for point earners (classic tasks)
* 20 million $XAND for developers building storage-enabled dApps on Xandeum
* 20 million $XAND for content creators & influencers

## Fairer Distribution Example
Using the square-root formula:
* User A: 1,000,000 points → square root = 1,000
* User B: 1,000 points → square root ≈ 31.6

## Other Updates
* Season 4 staking rewards (XAND staking & liquid staking) → DAO proposal coming soon
* New documentation live at xandeum.network/docs
* Major releases in the next few weeks: Ingolstadt v0.5, Stuttgart release, pNode–NFT assignment portal, and more
* SuperTeam Pro bounties launch next week – builders can earn USDC + $XAND

## What You Can Do Right Now
* Earn Airdrop 3 points at points.xandeum.network
* Join Discord and stay active (big point bonus!)
* Watch the DAO next week and vote with your $XAND
* Developers & creators: prepare for SuperTeam bounties

> Everything is 100% community-governed via the DAO. The team only proposes – $XAND holders make the final call.
