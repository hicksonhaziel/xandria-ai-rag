## Introduction to Xandeum Rewards
The Xandeum network offers various rewards for participating in the ecosystem. 

## Current Rewards Season
The current rewards season is from April 29, 2025 - July 29, 2025. 

## Earning Rewards
There are several ways to earn rewards on the Xandeum network:
* Liquid Stake SOL for xandSOL: Earn the highest yield in the industry with block rewards and storage-enabled liquid staking.
* Stake XAND in DAO: Use a constant lockup of 30 days or more to earn 16% APY on your XAND tokens.
* Provide Liquidity: Help enable smooth XAND trading by providing both SOL and XAND to earn your share of trading fees as well as extra rewards.
* Own XAND: Acquire XAND tokens to vote on key decisions and drive the Xandeum ecosystem forward.
* Earn Points: Earn points through Xandeum activities and show up in the leaderboard.

## Running a Xandeum Validator
Running a vNode on Xandeum's devnet will put you in a pole position to later run a vNode on mainnet as well as become an RPC provider for Xandeum. You will be able to receive rewards from the XFRP as well as XFDP (Xandeum foundation rewards program and Xandeum foundation delegation program).

## Running a Xandeum pNode
Operate a storage provider node (pNode) on devnet to help decentralize Xandeum’s network and earn XAND for your efforts.

## Upgrading XANDC to XAND
Swap XANDC for XAND tokens one-for-one—half now, half over 12 months. Gain full Xandeum ecosystem access and DAO governance rights.
