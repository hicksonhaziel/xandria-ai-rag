## Introduction to Xandeum pNode Economics
Xandeum's pNode system opens new ways to earn money in Web3 storage. pNodes are computers that help store data for a decentralized network on the Solana blockchain. Operators can earn XAND tokens by providing storage space. Factors like delegated stake, performance, and commission rates decide how much you earn.

## What is STOINC?
STOINC means Storage Income. It is how pNode operators earn XAND tokens. You run software from Xandeum and give storage space to the network. Earnings happen every epoch (about 2 days). They depend on "storage credits," calculated from four main things:
* Number of pNodes you own
* Total storage space you provide (in GB)
* Performance score (from 0 to 1, based on how reliable your pNode is)
* Amount of staked XAND (tokens locked to support the pNode)

For example, more pNodes or more storage means higher earnings. A good performance score and more staked XAND also help. If any factor is zero, you earn nothing that epoch.

> Important: 94% of STOINC goes to pNode operators – they are the main part of the network. Only 6% goes to development and operations. Storage comes from fees like transactions or app use.

## Why Delegated Stake is Important for Earnings
To make money with a pNode, you need stake (XAND tokens) delegated from others, not just your own. If you stake your own tokens, it's like staking normally – no extra benefit for running a pNode. Real profit comes from commissions (like 5%) on delegated XAND from the community or the Xandeum Foundation Delegation Program.

## Dutch Auction: How to Get Your pNode
The Dutch Auction sells 49 Deep South Era pNodes. It starts on September 6, 2025, at https://pnodestore.xandeum.network. Prices start high and drop over 48 hours.

| Time in Auction | Price (USDC + XAND) | NFT Type | Boost Multiplier | Total Boost with 16x Era |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Start (high price) | $4,900 USDC + 490,000 XAND | Titan | 11x | Up to 176x |
| End (low price) | $577 USDC + 57,700 XAND | Rabbit | 1.5x | Up to 24x |

## Rewards and Incentives Explained
pNode operators get fixed rewards, 10,000 XAND per month from the Foundation to cover costs. These are separate from variable STOINC. On mainnet, rewards are in SOL (about $210 per epoch example), easy to sell without price drops.

## What You Need to Run a pNode: Hardware and Operations
Running a pNode is easy with reliable setup:
* Internet: Stable with static IP. Use data centers like Contabo or Netcup – costs $5–$10 per month.
* Hardware: At least 256 GB storage, but use terabytes for better scale. Monitor performance to avoid penalties (like -100 credits for failures).
* Other: Software from Xandeum, no special skills needed, but keep it online for best scores.

## Recent Updates: Munich and Herrenberg Releases
Munich release at Rare Evo 2025 added file hosting and XandMiner GUI (tool for stats), showing storage power. Herrenberg adds basic search, helping sedApps for social media or research tools.
