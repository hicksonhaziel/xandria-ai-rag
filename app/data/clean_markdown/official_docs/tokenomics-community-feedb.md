## Tokenomics Community Feedback
The Xandeum community has presented new tokenomics and is seeking feedback. 
The tokenomics can be found at: https://www.xandeum.network/xand-tokenomics

## Community Discussion
One user had a initial positive impression of the tokenomics, but had several questions, including:
* Can XAND be used for liquid staking or is SOL required?
* If SOL is required, can XAND be swapped for SOL on a Solana DEX such as Jupiter?
* What is the approximate exchange rate between XAND and SOL?
