## Introduction to Xandeum's Dutch Auction and Herrenberg Release
Xandeum's recent milestones mark significant strides in decentralized storage for Solana. The Dutch Auction, launched on September 6, 2025, sold out 52 Deep South Era pNodes in just 34 hours, raising $200,000 for the Xandeum Foundation. The Herrenberg release introduces powerful features that enhance pNode functionality and set the stage for scalable, data-intensive dApps.

## Dutch Auction: A Resounding Success
The Dutch Auction, hosted on [pnodestore.xandeum.network](http://pnodestore.xandeum.network), began at 19:00 UTC on September 6, 2025. The event raised $134,000 in USDC and $60,000 in XAND, concluding 14 hours early on September 10. Each pNode came with a DevNet license and a unique 3D-rendered NFT to boost Storage Income (STOINC).

### Mechanics and Timeline
* Prices dropped every 30 minutes over a planned 48 hours, with bids requiring USDC and XAND.
* The first pNode sold in 5 seconds at $4,900 USDC + 490,000 XAND.
* Titan NFTs (11x multiplier) saw ~20 sales at $4,410, including 10 by one wallet.
* Dragon NFTs (5x multiplier) sold at $1,538, Coyotes (3x multiplier) at $942–$981, and Rabbits (1.5x multiplier) at $577–$601, with all pNodes gone by 05:00 UTC.

## Impact of the Dutch Auction
The auction's rapid sell-out reflects strong community confidence, creating a diverse pNode operator base poised to earn STOINC. Learn more at [Xandeum.network/stoinc](http://Xandeum.network/stoinc).

## Herrenberg Release: Elevating pNode Capabilities
The Herrenberg release builds on the Munich release's .txt file hosting prototype, introducing advanced features to Xandeum's storage layer. Designed to empower developers and pNode operators, Herrenberg enhances the infrastructure for sedApps (storage-enabled dApps), paving the way for mainnet by late 2025. Key features include:

* **PRPC Interface**: Herrenberg equips pNodes with a Remote Procedure Call (PRPC) interface, enabling seamless interaction with Solana's blockchain.
* **Gossip Protocol**: A new gossip protocol enables pNodes to communicate and share status updates, forming a decentralized network.
* **Crude Search Capabilities**: Herrenberg introduces basic search functionality, allowing users to query and retrieve data from Xandeum buckets—scalable, file-system-like storage units.
* **Community-Driven Analytics Platform**: The gossip protocol lays the groundwork for a pNode analytics platform, to be developed by the community.

## What This Means for pNode Operators and Developers
### pNode Operators
* Your Deep South Era pNode unlocks DevNet testing and eligibility for XAND stake via the Delegation Program.
* Maintain performance (heartbeats every 30 seconds, storage responses) to maximize credits and STOINC, amplified up to 176x with Titan NFTs.
* Secure your pNode by disabling SSH password login and using a non-standard port (not 22); see [Xandeum.network/docs](http://Xandeum.network/docs).

### Developers
* Herrenberg's RPC interface and search capabilities simplify building sedApps, leveraging Xandeum buckets for exabyte-scale storage.
* The gossip protocol ensures reliable data access, ideal for data-heavy applications.

## Looking Ahead
The auction's $200,000 fuels Xandeum's roadmap:
* **Engold Release (2–3 Weeks)**: Tracks pNode credits for 10,000 XAND/month DevNet rewards.
* **Stodgard Release**: Adds redundancy for mainnet launch by late 2025, enabling SOL-based STOINC.
* **Future Sales**: A potential Dutch Auction near mainnet will offer South Era pNodes with a lower boost (e.g., 7x vs. 16x).
