## Introduction
The blockchain landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, with Solana standing out as a high-performance & most viable platform capable of powering the next generation of decentralized applications dubbed dApps. However, one critical piece has been missing: scalable, efficient storage that integrates seamlessly with Solana smart contracts on the blockchain. At Xandeum, we’re addressing this gap by building a revolutionary scalable storage layer for Solana, and at the heart of this innovation are our pNodes—short for provider nodes.

## What are pNodes?
pNodes, or provider nodes, are the decentralized storage units that power Xandeum’s scalable storage layer on Solana. Unlike traditional Solana accounts, which store data across every validator node (approximately 2,000 at present of writing), Xandeum offloads storage to a separate network of pNodes. This design introduces a random-access, file-system-like storage layer that’s easily accessible by smart contracts, offering a solution that scales to exabytes of capacity without overburdening the Solana blockchain.

The Xandeum storage layer leverages pNodes to store data in a distributed manner, using erasure coding and configurable redundancy levels to ensure security and availability. Data is then managed, and distributed across multiple pNodes, supervised cryptographically by validator nodes (vNodes) running Xandeum-enabled software. This hybrid approach maintains blockchain-grade integrity while freeing Solana validators from the burden of storing every piece of data. Developers interact with this storage layer through extended Solana primitives—such as "peek" and "poke"—enabling seamless data transfers between Solana accounts and Xandeum’s “Buckets,” our decentralized file system abstraction.

## Why Buy pNodes?
Investing in pNodes offers a compelling opportunity for those looking to get in early on a transformative blockchain innovation. The value proposition of owning a pNode lies in both immediate rewards and long-term potential within the Xandeum ecosystem.

### Early Access and Rewards
In our inaugural “Deep South” era, we’re launching with a limited sale of just 300 pNodes, capped at 3 pNodes per wallet. Priced at 35,000 XAND each—equivalent to under $100 at current rates—these pNodes are able to be ran on a modest setup: we’ve found that you can run a small VPS (e.g., $5.50 a month) and our pNode software with efficient results. During our incentivized devnet, pNode operators can be expected to earn approximately 10,000 XAND per month, locked for 12 months. However, the real incentive lies beyond the devnet: establishing a foothold in Xandeum’s storage network as it transitions to main net.

### Proportional Rewards Model
Once the file-system-like storage layer is fully live, pNode rewards will be calculated based on a algorithm that multiplies performance, storage capacity provided, and stake (in XAND). Each pNode requires a stake in $XAND to operate, and operators can set a commission rate, retaining a portion of the rewards while distributing the rest to their stakers. This model mirrors the economics of validator nodes on other major blockchain networks, where early adopters secure a lasting advantage. As Xandeum grows and storage demand increases, early pNode operators will be positioned to capture a significant share of the fees generated by storage-enabled dApps (sedApps), paid in SOL.

## Who are pNodes for?
pNodes are designed for a diverse group of participants, each with unique motivations for joining the Xandeum network. Our scalable storage layer, set to go live later this year, targets three key audiences: sedApp developers, existing Solana validator operators, and blockchain enthusiasts looking to be on the forefront of web3 evolution.

### Developers Building sedApps
Our primary target in the “Deep South” stage is developers—“devs”—who will drive the adoption of Xandeum’s storage layer by building storage-enabled dApps, or sedApps. Once live, sedApps can leverage “XTransactions” (Xandeum Transactions) to move data between Solana accounts and the Xandeum storage layer using our dubbed “peek and poke” primitives. These transactions incur additional fees in SOL, with a portion (likely 4%) allocated to the XAND DAO ($XAND token holders) and the remainder distributed to pNode operators providing the storage service.

### Solana Validator Operators
pNodes also appeal to those already running Solana validators. These operators are familiar with the technical and economic dynamics of blockchain networks and can easily extend their expertise to Xandeum’s storage layer. By integrating pNodes into their operations, validators can diversify their potential revenue streams, earning SOL rewards from storage fees alongside traditional staking rewards.

### Blockchain Enthusiasts and Early Adopters
Finally, pNodes are for blockchain enthusiasts eager to get in on the ground floor of a promising project. Whether you’re a Web3 advocate, a Solana supporter, or simply someone looking for the next big opportunity, running a pNode offers a chance to participate in a pioneering effort. The low cost of entry, combined with the potential for significant rewards as the network scales, makes pNodes an attractive proposition for those who see the future of decentralized storage unfolding on Solana.

## Conclusion
pNodes are more than just storage providers—they’re the foundation of Xandeum’s mission to complete Solana’s vision as a decentralized world computer. By offering scalable, random-access storage that integrates natively with smart contracts, pNodes enable a new wave of innovative dApps while rewarding operators with both short-term and long-term benefits. Whether you’re a developer building the next killer sedApp, a Solana validator diversifying your portfolio, or an enthusiast passionate about web3’s future, pNodes offer a unique opportunity to shape and profit from the evolution of blockchain technology. With only 300 available in the “Deep South” era, the time to act is now—because in the world of blockchain, being early is everything.
