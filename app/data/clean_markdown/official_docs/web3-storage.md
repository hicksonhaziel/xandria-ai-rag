## Introduction to Web3 Storage
Discover the power of Xandeum pNodes, the backbone of scalable Solana storage. These decentralized pNodes use erasure coding to offload data from validators, enabling exabyte-scale dApps.

## Earning Opportunities
Earn ~10,000 XAND monthly on devnet or SOL fees on mainnet with easy setup via XandMiner. Boost Solana’s ecosystem while reaping rewards.
