## Introduction to XIP Ideas
The XIP Ideas category is for discussing and proposing new ideas for the Xandeum network.

## Proposal: Orbit Mobile
A native Android DePIN application for Solana Mobile Seeker has been proposed, which would enable users to contribute micro-storage capacity to the Xandeum network and earn XAND airdrop allocations. This application would leverage Seeker's Genesis Token ecosystem, TEEPIN hardware attestation, and the Solana dApp Store 2.0 to expand Xandeum's storage layer while rewarding mobile-first participants.

## Discussion
The proposed initiative aims to lower the barrier to entry, expand Xandeum's community, and validate mobile-first DePIN infrastructure while rewarding users for their contributions.

### Feedback
One user suggested that involvement on the Solana Mobile Seeker network could be useful, but also noted that the focus should be on pushing usability to avoid acquiring stagnant wallets where people are speculating on the price of XAND.
