## Introduction to Points Application
The Points Application is accessible at https://points.xandeum.network. It is designed to make interaction with Xandeum rewarding and integral to the growth of the ecosystem.

## Why We Track Engagement
Our platform thrives on active participation, and we believe in acknowledging every contribution. The Engagement Tracker is our way of quantifying your involvement through a points system. Whether you're spreading the word, engaging with our content, or participating in our ecosystem, we want to ensure your efforts are recognized and rewarded. Transparency is key: we request user data to accurately track and reward your actions.

## How It Works
### Connecting Your Wallet
Start by linking your wallet. This step is crucial for two reasons: it secures your participation in our ecosystem and serves as the foundation for tracking your engagement.

### Earning Points
Engage in a variety of activities, from social media interactions to subscribing to our channels. Each task has a point value, reflecting its contribution to our growth.

### Rewards and Progress
Your points accumulate, showing your effort and conviction. Progress is transparent, with a leaderboard to spark healthy competition and community spirit.

### Data Usage
The data we collect serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it verifies your completed tasks, ensuring an honest and efficient points allocation. Secondly, it enhances your user experience.

### Privacy
We respect your privacy. Data collection is minimal, purpose-driven, and always with your consent. We're committed to maintaining a secure environment where your information is protected.

## Engagement Tracker
Our Engagement Tracker is more than a rewards system; it's a cornerstone of the Xandeum community. By participating, you're not just earning points; you're propelling us forward, championing blockchain innovation, and paving the way for a decentralized future.
