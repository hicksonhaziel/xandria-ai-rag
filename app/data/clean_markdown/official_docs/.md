## Introduction to Xandeum
Xandeum is the solution for massive storage capacity needed for data-intensive applications to become a reality on Solana.

## Key Features
* Scalable to Exabytes+
* Smart Contract Native: Xandeum integrates directly with Solana's smart contract platform, enabling seamless and efficient data interaction for dApps.
* Random Access: Xandeum allows for quick and efficient retrieval of specific data, unlike solutions that only offer file-level access.

## Decentralized Storage
Decentralized storage needs to be scalable, decentralized, and have random access. Most solutions compromise, but Xandeum delivers on all three.

## Liquid Staking with Xandeum
Liquid Staking with Xandeum has its benefits:
* Storage-enabled dApps pay storage fees in SOL.
* Xandeum Liquid Staking captures these by delegating to Xandeum-enabled validators.
* When staking with us these storage rewards arrive in your wallet.

## Xandeum pNodes
Xandeum pNodes revolutionize Solana storage through decentralized solutions and erasure coding technology.
