## Introduction to Tmux
Tmux is a terminal multiplexor, allowing you to run more than one terminal instance in the same window and switch between them. 
It also allows you to have multiple pages that can have one or more panes of terminal windows.
Added benefits are that the windows all stay running and multiple people can view and work on the same session at the same time.
