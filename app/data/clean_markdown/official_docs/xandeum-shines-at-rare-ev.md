## Introduction to Xandeum at Rare Evo 2025
Xandeum is taking center stage at Rare Evo 2025, the premier blockchain and crypto conference in Las Vegas, with the live demo of our transformative Munich release. Unveiled at Caesars Palace, Munich introduces a scalable storage layer for Web3, empowering developers to build data-intensive dApps with ease.

## Munich Release: A Game-Changer for Web3 Storage
The Munich release, launched at Rare Evo, delivers a fully functional pNode prototype for file hosting on Xandeum’s storage layer—a monumental milestone. Built with Xandeum Web3.js, a thin layer atop Solana’s Web3.js, Munich enables developers to use familiar programming models while managing exabyte-scale data securely. 
> “We’ve made decentralized storage as intuitive as traditional file systems,” said CEO Bernie Blume.
Demo apps showcased at Rare Evo include a stealth-mode AI governance app and a decentralized Dropbox/Pastebin-like app, proving Munich’s real-world potential for dApps like social platforms or research hubs. The updated XandMiner GUI, powered by Xandeum Pod software, offers real-time pNode performance stats, simplifying network management.

## Community-Powered Innovation
Xandeum’s DevNet, driven by community-operated validators and pNodes, ensures Munich’s decentralized, transparent operations. The pNode monitoring UI, shared in our developer channels, provides live insights into network health, empowering our global community from the US to Nigeria and Japan. 
> “Our community is the heart of Xandeum,” Blume noted at Rare Evo.
This collaborative spirit, showcased through live demos, positions Xandeum as a leader in community-driven Web3 innovation.

## pNode Dutch Auction: Boost Your STOINC
Hot on Munich’s heels, our pNode Dutch Auction launches September 6, 2025, offering 50 Deep South Era pNodes, each with an NFT multiplier for Storage Income (STOINC). As detailed in our STOINC blog post, STOINC rewards depend on pNodes, storage, performance, and staked XAND. Starting at $4,900 USDC + 490,000 XAND for a Titan NFT (11x multiplier), prices drop over 48 hours to $577 USDC + 57,700 XAND for a Rabbit NFT (1.5x multiplier). Vote on the start time using the DutchDecider app with just 20 cents in USDC before September 5. Bid early to maximize income.

## Herrenberg and Beyond
We’re already developing the Herrenberg release, which will introduce crude search capabilities to enhance sedApp functionality. This builds on Munich’s foundation, advancing our mission to solve the blockchain storage trilemma: scalability, smart contract integration, and random access. Xandeum’s multi-chain adaptability ensures flexibility for developers across blockchains, fostering interoperability.
