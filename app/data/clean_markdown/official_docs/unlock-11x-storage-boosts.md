## Introduction to the Titan NFT Sale
The Titan NFT is a powerful tool for maximizing rewards on the Xandeum storage network. When paired with a pNode, it delivers an 11x multiplier on storage income—a 1,000% increase. This means earning more from apps storing data on Xandeum, with fees paid in SOL and shared with node operators.

## Why the Titan NFT Matters
* The Boost: 11x multiplier on storage income
* Timing: Exclusive to the "Deep South Era" with a 16x era boost, totaling a 176x multiplier
* Deadline: Sale closes on November 5, 2025, at 16:00 UTC

## Storage Income and NFT Tiers
Storage income, or "STOINC," comes from apps using Xandeum's storage layer. The NFT tiers are:
| NFT Tier | Boost Factor | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Titan | 11x | The top-tier boost for maximum rewards |
| Dragon | 4x | A strong mid-tier option |
| Coyote | 2.5x | Balanced for steady gains |
| Rabbit | 1.5x | A reliable entry-level boost |
| Cricket | 1x | The baseline boost |

## Time Travel Offer: Titan NFTs at Auction Prices
If you missed the auction but own a pNode, you can purchase a Titan NFT at the auction price, minus the initial pNode cost.

## How to Purchase Your Titan NFT
1. Visit titanstore.xandeum.network
2. Connect your Solana-compatible wallet with sufficient funds
3. Select the quantity of NFTs based on your unboosted pNodes
4. Agree to the terms of service
5. Complete the purchase and receive your NFT within days

## Why Boosts Benefit the Xandeum Community
Xandeum is built for real revenue, not just promises. Apps will pay SOL fees for storage, which node operators share based on their activity. Without a boost, a 1% share might earn 1 SOL daily; with a Titan, that's 11 SOL—same effort, bigger payout.

## Node Operations and Era System
* Only active nodes earn STOINC
* Keep your software updated and online
* The 176x multiplier (16x era × 11x NFT) is a strong incentive
* Check xandeum.network/stoinc for the full reward structure
