## Introduction to Xandeum's Munich Milestone
Xandeum’s journey to redefine decentralized storage on Solana is accelerating. The Munich release marked a historic milestone with a working prototype for hosting .txt files, showcasing the power of our storage layer.

## Munich Release: A Monumental Step
The Munich release, the first of our South Era, delivered a fully functional pNode prototype that enabled hosting .txt files on Xandeum’s storage layer—a monumental feat. While seemingly simple, this capability proves our smart contract-native, exabyte-scale storage can power data-intensive dApps. The updated XandMiner GUI, our pNode management tool, now displays basic stats for your pNode(s), offering insights into performance and network health via the Xandeum Pod software. This milestone, built on Solana’s high-speed consensus and erasure coding, sets the stage for scalable, tamper-proof storage.

## Herrenberg Release: Search Capabilities on the Horizon
Building on Munich’s success, we’re hard at work on the Herrenberg release, which will introduce crude search capabilities to our storage layer. This feature will enable users to query and retrieve data more efficiently, enhancing the functionality of sedApps (storage-enabled dApps). Herrenberg will further empower developers to build innovative applications, from social platforms to research hubs, solidifying Xandeum as the go-to platform for Web3 storage innovation.

## pNode Dutch Auction: Boost Your STOINC
Get ready for our pNode Dutch Auction, launching in the coming weeks. We’re releasing 50 Deep South Era pNodes, each bundled with an NFT that acts as a multiplier for your Storage Income (STOINC). As detailed in our STOINC blog post, STOINC rewards are based on pNodes, storage, performance, and staked XAND. The auction starts at a high price, decreasing over 24 hours. Don’t wait for the lowest price—higher-priced pNodes come with NFTs that offer greater STOINC multipliers, maximizing your income. Calculate your potential earnings at https://Xandeum.network/stoinc and join early to secure the best rewards.

## A dApp to Transform LLMs
We’re developing a revolutionary dApp on the Xandeum storage layer that will redefine how AI Large Language Models (LLMs) operate. While details are under wraps, this dApp will leverage our scalable, secure infrastructure to showcase Xandeum solves the Blockchain Trilemma. Designed alongside our storage layer, it will demonstrate the unmatched potential of building on Xandeum, setting a new standard for Web3 applications.

## Xandeum.network Gets a Facelift
Lastly, we’re giving Xandeum.network a vibrant redesign. All existing content stays, but we’re updating and enhancing the site’s look, feel, and branding to reflect Xandeum’s bold vision. This facelift will make it easier to explore our ecosystem and join the revolution.
