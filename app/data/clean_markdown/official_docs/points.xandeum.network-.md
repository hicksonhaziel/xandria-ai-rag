## Why We Track Engagement
Our platform thrives on active participation, and we believe in acknowledging every contribution. The Engagement Tracker is our way of quantifying your involvement through a points system. 
Whether you're spreading the word, engaging with our content, or participating in our ecosystem, we want to ensure your efforts are recognized and rewarded. 
Transparency is key: we request user data to accurately track and reward your actions. 
This data enables us to verify tasks you complete, ensuring a fair and rewarding system for all. 
Your privacy and trust are paramount, guiding our data handling practices.

## How It Works
### Connecting Your Wallet
Start by linking your wallet. This step is crucial for two reasons: it secures your participation in our ecosystem and serves as the foundation for tracking your engagement.

### Earning Points
Engage in a variety of activities, from social media interactions to subscribing to our channels. Each task has a point value, reflecting its contribution to our growth.

### Rewards and Progress
Your points accumulate, showing your effort and conviction. Progress is transparent, with a leaderboard to spark healthy competition and community spirit.

### Data Usage
The data we collect serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it verifies your completed tasks, ensuring an honest and efficient points allocation. Secondly, it enhances your user experience.

### Privacy
We respect your privacy. Data collection is minimal, purpose-driven, and always with your consent. We're committed to maintaining a secure environment where your information is protected.
