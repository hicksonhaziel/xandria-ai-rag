## XIP-0003 - Moratorium on Airdrops 3+
XIP-0003 proposes a temporary moratorium on future airdrops (Airdrop 3+) pending a strategic review.

## Background
The DAO proposal for a temporary moratorium on future airdrops has successfully passed as of December 25, 2025. Voting results indicate 65.5% in favor (approximately 17.95 million XAND votes) for pausing airdrops pending a strategic review, against 34.5% opposed (about 9.45 million votes).

## Key Elements of the Moratorium
* Halting all “Airdrop 3+” events until empirical evidence supports their efficacy.
* Mandating third-party verification and business cases for any future proposals.
* Aligning with broader blockchain governance trends toward sustainability and value protection, as seen in evolving DeFi protocols.
