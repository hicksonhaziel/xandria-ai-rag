## Introduction to the Xandeum Network Forum
The Xandeum Network forum is a shared community resource where members can share skills, knowledge, and interests through ongoing conversation.

## Guidelines for Civilized Discussion
To keep the discussion forum a kind and friendly place, please follow these guidelines:
* Always add something positive to the discussion
* Discover existing topics before replying or starting your own
* Be respectful of the topics and people discussing them, even when disagreeing
* Criticize ideas, not people
* Avoid name-calling, ad hominem attacks, and responding to a post's tone instead of its content

## Participation and Community Engagement
The conversations on this forum set the tone for every new arrival. To influence the future of this community:
* Engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be
* Avoid discussions that do not contribute to the community
* Use tools like bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, watching, and muting to improve your experience and others'

## Reporting Problems and Maintaining the Community
If you see a problem, flag it. Moderators will take action when enough flags accrue. To maintain the community:
* Don't reply to bad behavior, as it encourages and wastes time
* Flag bad behavior instead
* Moderators reserve the right to remove content and user accounts for any reason at any time

## Community Standards
To keep the forum civil:
> * Be civil and avoid posting anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech
> * Keep it clean and avoid posting anything obscene or sexually explicit
> * Respect each other and avoid harassing, griefing, impersonating, or exposing private information
> * Respect the forum and avoid posting spam or vandalizing the forum

## Organizing Content
To keep the forum tidy:
* Put topics in the right category
* Avoid cross-posting the same thing in multiple topics
* Avoid posting no-content replies
* Avoid diverting a topic by changing it midstream
* Avoid signing posts, as profile information is attached to each post
* Use the Like button instead of posting "+1" or "Agreed"
* Use Reply as a Linked Topic instead of taking an existing topic in a radically different direction

## Intellectual Property and Posting Guidelines
* Only post your own digital content
* Avoid posting anything that belongs to someone else without permission
* Avoid posting descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing intellectual property or breaking laws
