## Introduction to Xandeum
Xandeum is the solution for massive storage capacity needed for data-intensive applications to become a reality on Solana.
Xandeum integrates directly with Solana's smart contract platform, enabling seamless and efficient data interaction for dApps.
Xandeum allows for quick and efficient retrieval of specific data, unlike solutions that only offer file-level access.

## The Blockchain Storage Trilemma
Decentralized storage needs to be scalable, decentralized, and have random access.
Most solutions compromise, but Xandeum delivers on all three.

## Benefits of Xandeum Liquid Staking
Storage-enabled dApps pay storage fees in SOL.
Xandeum Liquid Staking captures these by delegating to Xandeum-enabled validators.
When staking with Xandeum, these storage rewards arrive in your wallet.

## Xandeum pNodes
Xandeum pNodes revolutionize Solana storage through decentralized solutions and erasure coding technology.
