## Introduction to Xandeum's Vision
Xandeum sparks the Cambrian Explosion in Web3 dApps by giving them a scalable storage layer that solves the Blockchain Storage Trilemma.

## Evolution of Blockchain Technology
The evolution of blockchain technology can be compared to the evolution of life on Earth:
- Big Bang: The beginning of everything
- Dawn Of Life: The first forms of (primitive) life emerge
- Cambrian Explosion: The ocean and land filled with newly evolved life forms, bringing about diversity and dynamism

## Blockchain Evolution
The blockchain evolution can be divided into three stages:
- Big Bang: The beginning of blockchain, with Bitcoin as the first blockchain
- Dawn Of Life: The first forms of life emerge, with Ethereum's birth making the blockchain programmable and enabling dApps to evolve
- Cambrian Explosion: Blockchain's Cambrian Explosion, driven by Xandeum's storage layer, capturing the dynamic burst of innovation where traditional Web2 apps evolve into storage-enabled Web3 apps and new forms of decentralized applications emerge
