## Problem: Missing Wallet in PNode Eligible List
**lulu:** 6/23/25, 5:15 PM
My wallet doesn't appear in the list of pnodes eligible for May payouts.
**niccolo45:** 6/23/25, 6:45 PM
I'll check transactions carefully
**Substance 2.42:** 6/23/25, 7:00 PM
I just manually opened all 26 executed transactions from DAO "May 2025 DevNet pNode payments".

## Problem: High Transaction Fees

Any time setting up the initial accounts for your wallet in the DAO, it opens multiple accounts and deposits the required rent to have the account open.

## Problem: June PNode Payouts
**foxdiddy:** 7/23/25, 3:33 PM
Has @Blockchain Bernie | Xandeum Labs said anything about June PNode payouts?
**Zedok:** 7/27/25, 3:46 PM
Wait for the Dao proposal. Connect your wallet; find your wallet address in the list; press the button. Rewards will be deposited in your DAO account.

## Problem: Claiming PNode Rewards
**Pheelix | Xandeum Champion:** 7/27/25, 2:01 PM
Is there a video somewhere on how to claim our PNode xand?
**Zedok:** 7/27/25, 3:46 PM
Wait for the Dao proposal. Connect your wallet; find your wallet address in the list; press the button. Rewards will be deposited in your DAO account.

## Problem: PNode Payment Delays
**Qi:** 8/8/25, 1:07 PM
Why did the pnode payment for June take so long?
**foxdiddy:** 8/8/25, 3:02 PM
Has it happened yet? We’re all waiting on June and July now.
**Substance 2.42:** 8/8/25, 3:39 PM
As for July node (vNode, pNode) rewards, I'm sure they'll set up unlock so it's unlocked in July 2026.

## Problem: Changing Wallet for PNode
**kryptobiten:** 8/20/25, 9:44 AM
Do anyone now how to change wallet the Pnode is attached to?
**mrhcon:** 8/20/25, 1:40 PM
There is not a way yet.
**Ymetro:** 8/20/25, 3:56 PM
Do ask the team directly by opening a ticket, as there is no way known to us users.

## Problem: Updating PNode
**MeMeTo:** 8/21/25, 1:46 PM
Is this the general way to check for an update?
**NeoBubba:** 8/21/25, 4:08 PM
I believe it is the best way.  Re-download the newest install with the script and hit #2 for the upgrade process
**Brad|Xandeum-imposter:** 8/28/25, 1:26 AM
To check for updates: https://pnodes.xandeum.network/pnode-update-version

## Problem: VPS Configuration for PNode
**Qi:** 8/22/25, 1:15 PM
Contabo's VPS products no longer have configuration packages suitable for running P nodes. Do you have any other recommendations?
**Ymetro:** 8/22/25, 2:35 PM
The 3 vCores should be enough for now. Upgrade later on when the network is more demanding. 
Consider NetCup as an alternative.
