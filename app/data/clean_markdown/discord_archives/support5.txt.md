## Problem: pNode Registration and Setup
**@mrhcon:** 4/14/25, 1:45 PM
You will do fine. Cut and paste the commands. Easy peasy.
**@Adonis:** Didnt do any research. Yep thought it would gain value over time
**@mrhcon:** And it will! Only if you run them! 10,000 XAND a month.
**@Adonis:** I did ask the Xandeum team for a refund of my Xandeum tokens. However they said it was not possible to make refunds
**@mrhcon:** You should just make the most of it and run them on rented servers. You'll be fine.
**@Adonis:** In my case would you recommend me renting 3 different servers to run all 3 pNodes?
**@Zedok:** The servers should pay for themselves. It is your decision to run all three or only one.

## Problem: SSH Tunnel and Server Access
**@Substance 2.42:** 4/14/25, 2:33 PM
Btw, as for installing using ssh on phone... I wonder if it is possible to run ssh tunnel + browser? Really not sure. (for pNode registration)
**@mrhcon:** Probably need to install a SSH Tunnel app. There are plenty of those offerings in the store.
**@Substance 2.42:** That's good info, thanks, did not know that.
**@Olaf V.:** Hello everybody, I have a question concerning the ssh tunnel to the server. What if my usual remote computer breaks down or I'd like to log in from a different machine... What were the things to do in advance, or in case of a breakdown...
**@Substance 2.42:** Quote from pNode Setup Guide: "Keep your SSH private key safe and backed up. If you lose it, you won't be able to access your pNode without assistance from your hosting provider."
**@Olaf V.:** Thank you for your reply. I understand that I have to backup things, but isn't the key linked to the machine that it was created on? What if I had to access the server from a different computer (having the key on a USB stick, maybe)
**@Substance 2.42:** "SSH keys are not tied to the machine where they were generated. You can back up the private and public key files (typically id_rsa and id_rsa.pub in the ~/.ssh/ directory) and restore them on another computer by copying them to the ~/.ssh/ directory on the new machine.

## Problem: Tax and Cost Basis for XAND Tokens
**@kezla:** 4/18/25, 12:38 PM
I'm back in FY2024 (ending 30 Jun 2024 for our tax year) - trying to find the cost basis OKU tokens and XAND tokens? What value were the OKU tokens before being switched into XAND tokens and was the conversion from OKU to XAND 1:1?
**@agregersen:** OKU never had an assigned value. Until the XAND token went live last October our tokens had no value. On the issue date I believe we started at $0.07 per token. The conversion from OKU to XAND was 1 for 1.

## Problem: pNode Registration Limit
**@Ymetro:** 4/25/25, 12:32 AM
Bought a second pNode today, but I got the error at registration: "You have already reached your maximum registration limit", and I only see the first one tied to my manager wallet.
**@Ymetro:** Has this anything to do with previously generated pNode Identity Pubkeys on newer installs I tested, that weren't registered yet?

## Problem: Permission Denied During Setup
**@Mindy:** 4/27/25, 4:54 PM
Hi when setting up my Pnode on Command tool i keep getting permission denied - after entering password even though it's correct
**@NeoBubba:** This is a server setup issue. You must have a typo or something in the password.

## Problem: Staking via Xandeum LST Website
**@S. Kuhlmann:** 4/27/25, 5:31 PM
did anyone had luck lately to stake via the Xandeum LST website ? I am getting an Transcation error when i tried to up my stake
**@Ymetro:** I did/do too have that problem. I just went to a DEX aggregator to swap to SandSOL and checked on the LST site if the amount was increased.

## Problem: Upgrading XANDC to XAND
**@ocd.andy:** 4/29/25, 10:52 AM
Hello, what's the process of upgrading XANDC to XAND now?
**@Zedok:** Check regularly for the next conversion window. No idea when the next one is.
