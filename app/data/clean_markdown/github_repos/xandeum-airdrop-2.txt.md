# Xandeum Airdrop 2: Building Our Path to Mainnet
## Executive Summary
The Xandeum team proposes to distribute 60 million XAND tokens through Airdrop 2, structured as three distinct batches of 20 million XAND each. This strategic approach recognizes different forms of community contribution while building the foundation for our mainnet launch.

## The Three-Batch Structure
The three batches serve a strategic purpose in our path to mainnet, and each represents a different way to contribute to Xandeum's success.

* Batch 1: Points Tracker Participants (20M XAND)
* Batch 2: SedApp Developers (20M XAND)
* Batch 3: Marketing & Content Creators (20M XAND)

## Batch 1: Points Tracker Participants
### Overview
The first 20 million XAND will be distributed to participants in our Points Tracker App who engaged with Xandeum through various community activities.

### Eligible Activities
* Watching Xandeum and Blockchain Bernie YouTube videos
* Engaging with X.com posts from Xandeum (likes, follows, shares)
* Participating in the Xandeum Discord community
* Other genuine community engagement activities

### Distribution Formula
To ensure a fairer distribution curve that benefits a broader range of participants, allocations will use a square root formula:
```python
User Allocation = (√(User Points) / Total √(Eligible Points)) × 20,000,000 XAND
```
### Token Vesting Schedule
All Airdrop 2 tokens include a vesting schedule to ensure long-term community alignment:
* 4-month cliff: Tokens cannot be claimed for the first 4 months after distributor funding (~120 days)
* 12-month continuous linear vesting: After the cliff, tokens vest continuously every minute over 12 months (~365 days)
* Claim anytime: You can claim your proportionally vested tokens at any time

## Batch 2: SedApp Developers
### Overview
The second batch rewards developers who build functional, innovative Storage Enabled Decentralized Apps (SedApps) on Xandeum's infrastructure.

### Technical Requirements
* Deployed on Xandeum mainnet (required to demonstrate real users with economic value)
* Utilizes Xandeum storage capabilities (not just Solana compute)
* Functional with real users and demonstrable economic activity
* Open-source or verifiable code for security review
* Documentation included (setup, usage, architecture)

### Allocation Structure
Developers earn XAND tokens in addition to any bounties they receive. Typical allocation ranges:
* Small projects/tools: 50,000 - 200,000 XAND
* Medium applications: 200,000 - 1,000,000 XAND
* Large/complex platforms: 1,000,000 - 5,000,000 XAND

### Token Vesting Schedule
All Batch 2 tokens follow the same vesting schedule as Batch 1.

## Batch 3: Marketing & Content Creators
### Overview
The third batch rewards those who create content and marketing materials that raise awareness of Xandeum and showcase our ecosystem's capabilities.

### Types of Content
* Video Content: tutorials, explainers, SedApp showcases, comparison videos
* Written Content: blog posts, technical guides, case studies, educational series
* Social Media & Creative: educational Twitter/X threads, multi-platform content campaigns, infographics

# Xandeum Airdrop Proposal
## Technical Questions
Q: What is a merkle distributor?
A: A smart contract that enables efficient, fair token distribution using cryptographic merkle trees. Gas efficient, verifiable, self-service, and transparent.

Q: How do I claim tokens?
A: Visit the official claim interface at https://airdrop.xandeum.network, connect your wallet, verify allocation, click claim, approve transaction. Tokens vest continuously after the 4-month cliff period - claim any amount of vested tokens at any time based on days/minutes elapsed since your cliff ended.

Q: Is the distributor audited?
A: Yes, based on battle-tested open-source code and reviewed before deployment. Details provided before second vote.

Q: Can someone steal my allocation?
A: No. Only your wallet address can claim your specific allocation.

## Timeline Questions
Q: What's the complete timeline?
* Now: Community reviews proposal
* Week 1: First DAO vote
* Week 2-3: Merkle distributor creation
* Week 3: Second DAO vote
* Week 4: Batch 1 claims begin
* Week 4+: Monthly review cycles for Batches 2 & 3

Q: How long will Batches 2 & 3 stay open?
A: Until each 20M allocation is exhausted. Based on anticipated submissions (~2 large, ~10 medium, ~20 small projects per batch), we expect the rolling distribution to continue for several months.

## Security Questions
Q: How do you prevent multiple accounts?
A: Verified wallet connections, demonstrable work products, team reviews for suspicious patterns, community voting, blockchain analysis. Violations = disqualification.

Q: How do you prevent plagiarism?
A: Require verifiable links/repositories, check for copied work, timestamps matter, community can flag suspicious submissions. Violations = immediate disqualification and blacklisting.

Q: What prevents team favoritism?
A: All approvals require DAO voting, public evaluation criteria, transparent reasoning, community can reject recommendations, all votes recorded on-chain.

## Appendix: How the Square Root Formula Works
A Visual Guide to Understanding Fair Distribution

This section breaks down the math behind the square root formula in simple terms, with step-by-step examples and visual comparisons.

### Overview
This appendix provides a detailed comparison of the Linear vs Square Root distribution formulas across 100 hypothetical sample users with simulated points ranging from 1,500,000 (highest) down to 350 (lowest).

### Formulas
#### Linear Distribution
User Allocation = (User Points / Total Points) × 20,000,000 XAND

#### Square Root Distribution
User Allocation = (√User Points / Total √Points) × 20,000,000 XAND

### Understanding the Square Root Formula
This section breaks down the Square Root distribution formula piece by piece, showing exactly how the math works and why it creates a more equitable distribution.

#### What is a Square Root?
The square root (√) of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives you the original number.

Examples:
* √100 = 10 (because 10 × 10 = 100)
* √10,000 = 100 (because 100 × 100 = 10,000)
* √1,000,000 = 1,000 (because 1,000 × 1,000 = 1,000,000)

#### Key Property: Square roots grow much slower than the original numbers.
When you double a number, its square root only increases by about 41%.

Example:
* 100 points → √100 = 10
* 200 points (2× more) → √200 = 14.14 (only 1.41× more)
* 400 points (4× more) → √400 = 20 (only 2× more)

### Step-by-Step: How the Formula Works
Let's break down the formula into its components:
User Allocation = (√User Points / Total √Points) × 20,000,000 XAND

The formula has 3 main parts:
1. Calculate Square Root of User's Points: √User Points
2. Calculate User's Percentage Share: (√User Points / Total √Points)
3. Apply Percentage to Total XAND Pool: × 20,000,000 XAND

### Complete Calculation Example: User #1
Let's walk through a complete calculation for User #1, who has the most points.

Given:
* User #1 Points: 1,500,000
* Total Points (all users): 10,017,835
* Total √Points (all users): 51,482.70
* XAND Pool: 20,000,000

Step 1: Calculate square root of user's points: √1,500,000 = 1,224.74
Step 2: Calculate user's percentage of total square roots: 1,224.74 ÷ 51,482.70 = 0.02379 (2.379%)
Step 3: Apply percentage to XAND pool: 0.02379 × 20,000,000 = 475,774 XAND

Result: User #1 receives 475,774 XAND

### Side-by-Side Comparison: Linear vs Square Root
Let's compare how User #1 and User #50 are treated under both formulas:

User #1 (1,500,000 points) - Highest Points
* Linear Formula: 2,994,600 XAND (14.973% of pool)
* Square Root Formula: 475,774 XAND (2.379% of pool)
User #1 receives 84% less under SQRT formula

User #50 (15,500 points) - Middle Tier
* Linear Formula: 31,056 XAND (0.155% of pool)
* Square Root Formula: 48,401 XAND (0.242% of pool)
User #50 receives 56% more under SQRT formula

### Why This Formula Works
The square root formula achieves three key objectives:
1. Compresses the Gap Between High and Low Earners
2. Maintains Top Contributor Recognition
3. Creates Meaningful Allocations Throughout

### The Math Behind "More Equitable"
Here's exactly how the redistribution works mathematically:
Total XAND to Redistribute: 20,000,000

Under Linear Formula:
* Top 10 users control: 12,478,040 XAND (62.39%)
* Everyone else shares: 7,521,960 XAND (37.61%)

Under Square Root Formula:
* Top 10 users control: 3,746,464 XAND (18.73%)
* Everyone else shares: 16,253,536 XAND (81.27%)

Net Effect:
* 8,731,576 XAND redistributed from top 10 to remaining 90 users
* That's 43.66% of the entire pool being redistributed to create fairness

Per User Impact:
* Each of the top 10 gives up: 873,158 XAND average
* Each of the bottom 90 gains: 97,018 XAND average

### Visual Representation: The Compression Effect
Here's how the square root "compresses" the distribution:
Points Distribution (Linear - Exponential Gap):
User #1: 1,500,000 pts
User #10: 450,000 pts
User #50: 15,500 pts
User #100: 350 pts

Square Root Transformation (Compressed Gap):
User #1: √1,500,000 = 1,224.74
User #10: √450,000 = 670.82
User #50: √15,500 = 124.50
User #100: √350 = 18.71

XAND Allocation (More Equitable):
User #1: 475,774 XAND
User #10: 260,565 XAND
User #50: 48,401 XAND
User #100: 10,690 XAND

### Sample Data Set (Simulated for Demonstration)
Total Users: 100 (hypothetical sample)
Highest Points: 1,500,000 (simulated)
Lowest Points: 350 (simulated)
Point Distribution: Exponential decay to simulate realistic engagement patterns
Total Points Pool: 20,000,000 XAND (example allocation for Batch 1)

### Key Statistics Summary
Total Points: 10,017,835
Total Square Roots: 51,482.70

### Distribution Comparison
Metric | Linear Formula | SQRT Formula | Impact
-----|---------------|--------------|--------
Top 10 Users Share | 62.39% (12.5M XAND) | 18.73% (3.7M XAND) | -70%
Middle 40 Users Share | 30.15% (6.0M XAND) | 40.82% (8.2M XAND) | +35%
Bottom 50 Users Share | 7.46% (1.5M XAND) | 40.45% (8.1M XAND) | +442%

Key Insight: Square root formula redistributes ~8.7M XAND from top 10 users to middle and bottom tiers, creating more equitable distribution while still rewarding top contributors substantially.

## Key Findings
### Redistribution Effect
The top 10 users (with the highest points) receive:
* Linear: 12,478,040 XAND (62.39%)
* SQRT: 3,746,464 XAND (18.73%)
* Impact: -70% allocation, redistribution of 8.7M XAND

The middle 40 users (with 15,500 - 400,000 points) receive:
* Linear: 6,030,160 XAND (30.15%)
* SQRT: 8,164,416 XAND (40.82%)
* Impact: +35% allocation, gain of 2.1M XAND

The bottom 50 users (with 350 - 15,500 points) receive:
* Linear: 1,491,800 XAND (7.46%)
* SQRT: 8,089,120 XAND (40.45%)
* Impact: +442% allocation, gain of 6.6M XAND

### Break-Even Point
User #38 (with 38,000 points) is approximately break-even in this example:
* Linear: 75,888 XAND
* SQRT: 75,697 XAND
* Difference: -191 XAND (-0.3%)

### Maximum Impact
User #100 (with 350 points) shows maximum benefit:
* Linear: 815 XAND
* SQRT: 10,690 XAND
* Benefit: +9,875 XAND (+1,211.7%)

## Visual Distribution Comparison
The following visualizations illustrate the distribution of XAND among users:
* Top 10 Users: 
  + User #1 (1.5M points): 
    - Linear:   [████████████████████████████████] 2,994,600 XAND
    - SQRT:     [██████] 475,774 XAND
    - Difference: -84.1%
* Mid-Tier User #50: 
  + User #50 (15,500 points): 
    - Linear:   [█] 31,056 XAND
    - SQRT:     [██] 48,401 XAND
    - Difference: +55.8%
* Lower-Tier User #90: 
  + User #90 (850 points): 
    - Linear:   [▌] 1,816 XAND
    - SQRT:     [█████████] 12,980 XAND
    - Difference: +614.8%

## Conclusion
The square root formula creates a significantly more equitable distribution while still rewarding top contributors:
* Top users still receive substantial allocations (475K XAND for #1 in this example)
* Mid-tier users see 35-55% increases in allocations
* Lower-tier users see 200-1200% increases, making participation worthwhile
* Break-even point at ~38,000 points ensures fairness across the spectrum
This approach maximizes community goodwill while preventing extreme concentration at the top, creating a healthier token distribution for long-term ecosystem growth.
