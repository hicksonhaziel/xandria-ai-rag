## Introduction to Z
The story of Z is quite simple. As a fan of starting with why, the reason for creating Z is to address the limitations of building meaningful apps on blockchain and crypto. Since 2013, the industry has been limited by storage capacity, making it difficult to build real apps.

## The Problem with Blockchain Storage
Blockchain accounts can store maybe a megabyte, which is not enough to build meaningful apps. This limitation makes it expensive and impossible to build apps that require more storage. The goal of Z is to make blockchain and crypto real, enabling the creation of real apps.

## The Importance of Decentralization
Decentralization is the reason blockchain and crypto exist. Without decentralization, authorities dictate the rules, and individuals have limited power. Decentralization is essential for giving individuals the power to determine their own destiny.

## Current State of Web 3
Web 3 is currently in its early stages, similar to the web 2 era. Most web 3 pages are static, and users can only read, consume, and perform limited actions. The applications are not where they need to be, and there is a need for a storage layer to expand web 3 and make it more data-intensive.

## Breaking Barriers with Zenium
Zenium aims to break the barriers limiting blockchain and crypto. The team is working on building a storage layer to enable the creation of real apps. The goal is to spark a Cambrian explosion in decentralized apps, similar to the one that occurred in AI with the introduction of artificial neural networks.

## The Cambrian Explosion in AI
The introduction of artificial neural networks in the mid-2000s led to a Cambrian explosion in AI, enabling voice recognition, reasoning, and other advancements. Similarly, Zenium believes that a storage layer is the enabling technology needed to spark a Cambrian explosion in decentralized apps.

## The Need for a Storage Layer
The storage layer is essential for building meaningful apps on blockchain and crypto. Without it, apps are limited, and the industry is stuck in a state similar to web 1. The storage layer will enable the creation of decentralized apps that are currently impossible to build.

## Conclusion
The team at Zenium is working on building a storage layer to enable the creation of real apps on blockchain and crypto. The goal is to spark a Cambrian explosion in decentralized apps, making web 3 more data-intensive and enabling the creation of meaningful apps.

**Bernie:** Somebody needs to make blockchain and crypto real, so that we can build real apps.

**Sean:** We're making the storage layer to be able to expand web 3 and make it more data-intensive.
