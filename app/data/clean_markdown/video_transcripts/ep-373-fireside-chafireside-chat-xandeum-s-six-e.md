## Introduction to Xandeum's Storage Layer
The need for a storage layer is huge, but how will it be achieved? The current storage limitations on Solana require a second tier of Solana accounts. This new layer will be similar to Solana accounts but will also incorporate a file system, allowing for random access and scalability to exobytes.

## The Problem with Current Storage Solutions
Current storage projects like Filecoin and Weave are not designed to make smart contracts more versatile. They are archival solutions, not designed for random access or modifying files. Xandeum's storage layer will be a world file system, allowing for opening files, positioning the read head, and overwriting data.

## Xandeum's Solution
Xandeum is building a storage layer that scales to exobytes and more, with a file system model that allows for random access. This will enable a Cambrian explosion of new web 3 apps. The Xan Miner is being developed to be super user-friendly, with a UI/UX that makes sense for end users.

## Technical Details
For a Xandeum-enabled app on Solana, a special RPC node is required. This node will run modified software that understands Xandeum transactions. A sidecar process called Dock will run on the same computer as the RPC node, acting as a mediator between the validator software and the Xandeum storage layer.

## Becoming a Storage Provider
To become a storage provider through Xandeum, a Solana validator can install the modified RPC node software and run a sidecar process. Validators can also challenge P nodes to ensure they are storing data correctly, generating proofs and Merkle proofs. This will allow validators to make additional revenue and receive rewards.

## Running a Xandeum Node
Running a Xandeum node is designed to be accessible to anyone, with minimal technical requirements. The rewards for running a P node are proportional to the storage provided, and nodes can be run by anyone with a good internet connection.

## Conclusion
Xandeum's storage layer is designed to be scalable, user-friendly, and accessible to anyone. With millions of P nodes needed to store exabytes of data, the potential rewards for running a node are significant. Stay tuned for more information on how to get involved with Xandeum's storage layer.
