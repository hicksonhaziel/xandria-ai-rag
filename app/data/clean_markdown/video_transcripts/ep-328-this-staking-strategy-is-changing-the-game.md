## Introduction to Storage Enabled Liquid Staking
Storage enabled liquid staking is a game-changing staking strategy that allows users to stake their Solana (SOL) tokens while maintaining liquidity. This strategy is made possible by Xandum, a scalable storage layer for the Solana chain.

## How Storage Enabled Liquid Staking Works
Storage enabled liquid staking works by allowing users to stake their SOL tokens in a liquid staking pool, which is then used to validate transactions on the Solana chain. In return, users receive Zan tokens, which can be traded on exchanges like Jupiter.

## Benefits of Storage Enabled Liquid Staking
The benefits of storage enabled liquid staking include:
* High yields: Storage enabled liquid staking offers high yields, with expected APYs ranging from 8-11%.
* Liquidity: Users can unstake their tokens at any time, without having to wait for the end of an epoch.
* Diversification: Storage enabled liquid staking allows users to diversify their portfolio by staking with multiple validators.

## Validators and Block Rewards
Xandum works with multiple validators, each of which contributes to the pool's APY. Validators also share block rewards with users, which can increase the overall yield. The current validators and their respective block rewards can be found on the Xandum network website.

## Zan Token and Its Utility
The Zan token is the native token of the Xandum network and has several use cases, including:
* Governance: Zan token holders can participate in governance decisions for the Xandum network.
* Staking: Zan tokens can be staked to earn additional rewards.
* Trading: Zan tokens can be traded on exchanges like Jupiter.

## Boosted Rewards and Launchpad Stage
Xandum is currently in the Launchpad stage, which offers boosted rewards for users who stake their SOL tokens. The boosted rewards are 4X the normal rewards and will be available until the stake reaches 100,000 SOL.

## Getting Started with Storage Enabled Liquid Staking
To get started with storage enabled liquid staking, users can follow these steps:
1. Go to the Xandum network website and click on the "Stake" tab.
2. Connect your wallet and select the amount of SOL you want to stake.
3. Confirm the transaction and receive your Zan tokens.
