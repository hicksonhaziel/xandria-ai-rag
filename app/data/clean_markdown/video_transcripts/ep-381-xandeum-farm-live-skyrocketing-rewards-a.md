## Introduction to Dutch Auctions
Dutch auctions got their name from the Netherlands way back in the 17th century during tulip mania. Sellers used Dutch auctions to move tulip bulbs fast. They'd start with a high price and then drop it until someone said, "Yes, I'll take it." It was perfect for selling stuff that couldn't sit around like flowers. [Timestamp: 4:20]

## History of Dutch Auctions
Tulip mania wasn't just a flower craze. It was one of the first economic bubbles ever recorded. Prices for tulip bulbs shot up to insane levels and Dutch auctions help sellers cash in quickly. Today, this method still lives on. Think flower markets in Holland or even government treasury bill sales. It's all about speed and efficiency. [Timestamp: 8:40]

## How Dutch Auctions Work
Imagine selling a rare NFT. Start high, say 100 ETH. No takers. Drop it to 90 ETH, then 80 ETH, and keep going. The price falls from a ceiling price until someone jumps in and says, "Mine, that's it." The first bidder to accept the current price wins. It's the opposite of an English auction where bids start low and then climb up.

## Pros and Cons of Dutch Auctions
Pro number one, it's fast. The price drops and until someone bites, so no long bidding wars. Pro two, it dodges the winner's curse. In English auctions, you might overpay in the heat of the moment. With a Dutch auction, you just pick your price. Less panic, more control. But there's a flip side. There's a con. Con number one, sellers might not get top dollar if someone grabs it early. And con number two, buyers could wait too long for a steal and miss out. [Timestamp: 16:10]

## Dutch Auctions in Blockchain and Crypto
Dutch auctions are used in blockchain and crypto all the time. Take token sales for one. Projects use Dutch auctions to spread tokens out evenly. No whale domination. Another spot, decentralized finance or DeFi. In lending protocols, if someone's loan goes underwater, their collateral gets liquidated via Dutch auction. Price starts high, drops fast, and someone scoops it up to settle the debt. It's quick and market driven.

## Real-World Examples
The Gnosis ICO in 2017 used a Dutch auction for their GNO tokens. They set a high starting price and capped how much ether they'd raised. The price dropped over time and buyers bid whenever they liked. Once the Ether cap was hit, the auction stopped. Everyone paid the final price. Super transparent. It raised what they needed and spread the tokens wide. [Timestamp: 24:50]

## Xandium's Use of Dutch Auctions
Xandium plans to use a Dutch auction for the roughly 50 P nodes that are being sold in addition to the 300 that have already been sold. There is a limited supply, right? And with Xandium, the Dutch auction for the remaining P nodes, it will all be about anyone can buy as many as they want. And we're starting at a relatively high price and it's going to be dropping each and every hour.

## Dutch Auction Details
The current thinking is like Xandium is likely going to do it like for 12 hours, right? It's going to drop 10% every hour, each and every hour. So it starts at some point and then we have a drop of 10% for 12 hours and then we have another 36 hours where it drops something around 5% every hour each and every hour. [Timestamp: 34:10]

## Payment Requirements
You will have to make a payment in Xand tokens as we had before with the initial P node sale but there will also be a USDC payment. We give the utility to the ZAN token. So you need ZAN tokens to buy the remaining P nodes. Which is great for the price of the ZAN token and it creates demand for the Zen token and gives you utility for your ZAN token.

## Conclusion
Dutch auctions start high, drop low, and whenever someone buys, they buy. With the P node sale in Xandium, we're going to request or require both for P nodes, right? So you will have to make a payment in Xand tokens as we had before with the initial P node sale but there will also be a USDC payment. [Timestamp: 42:40]
