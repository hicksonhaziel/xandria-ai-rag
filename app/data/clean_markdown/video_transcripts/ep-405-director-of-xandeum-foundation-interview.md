## Introduction to Xandium Network
The Xandium network is a storage layer on Salana, and it's almost ready for launch. The network will have storage fees paid by apps built on the Xandium storage layer. There will be an airdrop 2, and the announcement will be made soon.

## Titan NFT
The Titan NFT gives an 11x boost in storage income for running the Xandium storage network. The NFT can be purchased for 4,410 USDC plus 46,000 Zand. This offer is for people who already have a P node but don't have a Titan NFT.

## Dutch Auction
The Dutch auction was held last month, and the prices for the NFTs were:
* Dragon NFT: 4x boost factor
* Coyote NFT: 2.5x boost factor
* Rabbit NFT: 1.5x boost factor
* Cricket NFT: 1x boost factor
* Titan NFT: 11x boost factor

## Purchasing Titan NFT
To purchase a Titan NFT, go to the Titan store at [titanstore.zandium.network](http://titanstore.zandium.network). The sale ends on November 5th, 1600 UTC. The purchase process involves agreeing to the terms of service and paying the required amount.

## Xandium Foundation
The Xandium Foundation is a separate entity from Xandium Labs. The foundation is offering the Titan NFT as a way to reward early supporters. The NFT boost factor multiplies with the era boost factor, resulting in a 176x boost.

## Storage Income
The storage income, also known as "stoink," can be found on the Xandium website at [xandium.network](http://xandium.network). The website explains the rewards and math behind the storage income.
