## Introduction to My Daily Routine
I'm Blockchain Bernie, CEO of Xandeum Labs. My day starts at 6:30 a.m. with a morning routine that includes meditation and language learning. I use the Inside Timer app for meditation and spend about five minutes on it. I also do language learning, specifically Mandarin Chinese, for about five minutes in the morning and 10-15 minutes in the evening.

## Development and Team Meetings
At 7:00 a.m., I have a meeting with my development team, which consists of three developers and myself. We discuss the status of our projects, including the storage layer we're building. I also work on development tasks, such as modifying the Salana validator, and help my team with any questions they have. Sometimes, our meetings can go on for hours, especially when we're working on tough problems.

## Marketing and Community Engagement
In addition to development, I also focus on marketing and community engagement. We have a marketing team that includes Sean, Verena, and Eric, who work on growing our community and spreading the word about Xandeum. I also engage with our community through social media and videos.

## Administrative Tasks
I also spend time on administrative tasks, such as managing our finances, accounting, and ensuring that everything is funded. I keep control over our finances, including bank accounts and crypto wallets, and make sure that all our important smart contracts are secure.

## Work-Life Balance
My days are often filled with work, and it can be challenging to balance work and personal life. However, I believe that work is a part of life, and I don't like to separate the two. I try to take breaks and do things I enjoy, such as swimming in my pool or spending time with my wife.

## Why I Do What I Do
I'm working on Xandeum because I believe it has the potential to make a huge impact on the world. Our goal is to build a storage layer that will enable decentralized apps to reach billions of people. I'm driven by the vision of creating a more self-determined world, where individuals are less dependent on centralized authorities.
