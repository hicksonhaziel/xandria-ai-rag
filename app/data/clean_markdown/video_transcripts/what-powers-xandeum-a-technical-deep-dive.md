## Introduction to Xandeum
The need for a storage layer is huge, and Xandeum is changing the landscape not only for Solana but for the entire blockchain industry. The storage layer will look like a second tier of Solana accounts, but with a file system that allows for random access, similar to what people are used to with their computers.

## The Problem with Current Storage Solutions
Current storage solutions like Filecoin are not designed to make smart contracts more versatile, but rather to store data in a decentralized manner. They do not provide random access, which is necessary for creating new types of apps. Xandeum is building a world file system that scales to exobytes and more, with random access, to spark a Cambrian explosion of web 3 apps.

## The Xandeum File System
The Xandeum file system will allow for opening files, positioning the read head within a file, and overwriting data, similar to what people have been used to since the 60s. This is a well-known programming model that Xandeum is bringing to blockchain. The goal is to make it easy for developers to build new types of apps that are not possible with current storage solutions.

## User Experience
The Xan Miner is being developed to be super user-friendly, with a GUI that makes it easy for anyone to use, including non-technical people. This is different from running a Solana validator, which requires technical skills and is command-line based. The goal is to make it easy for millions of people to participate in the Xandeum network.

## Xandeum Enabled RPC Nodes
For a Xandeum-enabled app on Solana, developers will need to go through a special RPC node that understands Xandeum transactions. Xandeum will provide these RPC nodes initially, but other RPC providers can also enable their nodes to support Xandeum. A sidecar process called "dock" will run on the same computer as the RPC node, acting as a mediator between the validator software and the Xandeum storage layer.

## Becoming a Storage Provider
To become a storage provider through Xandeum, a Solana validator can install the modified RPC node software and start providing storage. Validators can also challenge storage providers to ensure they are storing data correctly, and can earn additional revenue and rewards for participating in the network.

## Running a Xandeum Node
Running a Xandeum node is designed to be accessible to anyone, with minimal technical requirements. The node operators will be the core of the Xandeum storage layer and will do the heavy lifting, earning the majority of the storage rewards. The rewards will be proportional to the storage provided, and node operators can share their rewards with stakers and validators.

## Conclusion
Xandeum is creating a new storage layer that will enable a wide range of new web 3 apps. The Xandeum file system will provide random access, and the Xan Miner will make it easy for anyone to participate in the network. With millions of node operators needed to support the network, Xandeum is designed to be accessible to anyone, with minimal technical requirements.
