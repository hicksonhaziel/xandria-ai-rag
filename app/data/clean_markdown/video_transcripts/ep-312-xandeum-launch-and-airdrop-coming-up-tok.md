## Introduction to Xandeum Tokenomics
The launch of the Xan token is scheduled for October 29th, along with the first airdrop. The token will be listed on DEXs and centralized exchanges, including Mexi and Bit. [Timestamp: 0:05]

The Xandeum Foundation is launching the storage-enabled staking reward. The foundation's website has a learn page with information on the vision, storage layer, launch timeline, and tokenomics.

## Xandeum Foundation and Tokenomics
The Xandeum Foundation has finalized the tokenomics, which includes a 15% allocation to the team and early team members. Approximately 34% of this allocation is reserved for future team members. [Timestamp: 5:00]

There is also an allocation for Zan classic holders, who can swap their old tokens for new ones. The airdrop will consist of five rounds, with the first round allocating 60 million tokens.

## Token Allocation and Distribution
The total supply of Xan tokens is 4.15 billion, with 580 million expected to be circulating on day one and 851 million after 12 months. The mint address is available on the Xandeum Foundation's website, and the minting is disabled to prevent any additional tokens from being created.

The token allocation includes:
* 15% to the team and early team members
* 11.8% to Zan classic holders
* 5 airdrops, with the first round allocating 60 million tokens
* A foundation reserve managed by the Xandeum Foundation
* A community DAO reserve managed by the community

## DAO and Governance
The Xan token is the governance token for the DAO, which will receive all the rewards generated by the Xandeum network. The DAO will be responsible for managing the storage layer, liquid staking, and other aspects of the network. [Timestamp: 15:00]

The tokenomics are designed to benefit the community, with a large share of the tokens managed by the DAO. This allows token holders to control the network and receive rewards for their participation.

## Comparison to Other Projects
The Xandeum tokenomics are compared to other projects, such as Jeto, which has a similar governance token but with different tokenomics. The Xandeum tokenomics are considered more beneficial to the community, with a larger share of tokens managed by the DAO.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
The Xandeum tokenomics are considered exciting and beneficial to the community. The launch of the Xan token and the first airdrop are scheduled for October 29th. [Timestamp: 25:00]

It is recommended to check out the Xandeum Foundation's website and join the discussion on their channels to learn more about the tokenomics and the project. The tokenomics are considered a nice scheme, with a transparent and community-driven approach.
