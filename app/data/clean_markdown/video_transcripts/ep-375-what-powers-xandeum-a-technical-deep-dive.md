## Introduction to Xandeum
Xandeum is a project that aims to provide a decentralized storage solution. The team is building it in public, with a roadmap of 30 releases partitioned into six eras. Each release is planned out, and the team is working on the second release, called the Fryberg release, in the Deep South era.

## The Six Eras of Xandeum
The six eras are:
1. Deep South
2. South
3. Mine
4. Central
5. Coal
6. North
Each era has multiple releases, and the team is working on completing all 30 releases by the end of 2025.

## Technical Components of Xandeum
The technical components of Xandeum include:
* Atlas: a distributed database that knows what file is stored on which node
* Pods: software that runs on provider nodes and responds to challenges
* Xand Minor: an administrative GUI for managing provider nodes
These components work together to provide a decentralized storage solution.

## Community Involvement
The Xandeum team believes that community involvement is crucial to the success of the project. They encourage people to join their community, run nodes, and participate in governance. The team is committed to transparency and honesty, and they want to build a community that is helpful and supportive.

## Governance and Tokenomics
The Xandeum team has a decentralized governance model, with a DAO that makes decisions for the project. The team also has a tokenomics model, where 94% of fees go to provider nodes, 4% go to the DAO treasury, and 2% go to a reserve fund.

## Getting Involved
People can get involved with Xandeum by:
* Buying the Xand token
* Running a provider node
* Joining the community and participating in governance
* Building apps on the Xandeum platform

## Roadmap and Future Plans
The Xandeum team plans to complete all 30 releases by the end of 2025. They will then focus on polishing the solution and making it more scalable and performant. The team believes that they have a first-mover advantage and want to hurry through the six eras to keep that advantage.

## Decentralized Apps and Storage
The Xandeum team believes that decentralized apps will become the norm, and that storage will be a key component of these apps. They want to provide a decentralized storage solution that is fast, secure, and scalable.

## Comparison to Other Projects
The Xandeum team compares their project to others, such as Salana and Filecoin. They believe that their solution is more comprehensive and scalable than others in the space.

## Call to Action
The Xandeum team encourages people to get involved with the project, either by buying the Xand token, running a provider node, or joining the community. They believe that their project has the potential to disrupt the storage industry and provide a new paradigm for decentralized apps.
