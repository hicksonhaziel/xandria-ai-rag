## Introduction to Xandeum AMA
Bernie's Xandeum AMA is a live session where the community can ask anything about the project. 
The goal of this session is to provide clarity on the Xandeum project and its current status.
[Timestamp: 00:01:23]

## Project Overview
Xandeum is a blockchain-based project that aims to provide a decentralized solution for various use cases.
The project has been in development for some time, and the team is working hard to deliver a working product.
The community has been eagerly waiting for updates on the project's progress.

## Technical Details
The Xandeum team has been working on the project's architecture, ensuring that it is scalable and secure.
The team has chosen to use a specific consensus algorithm to achieve consensus among nodes on the network.

## Introduction to P Node Launch
The P Node launch is a significant milestone for the Xandum project, marking the introduction of Provider Nodes that will handle data storage. The launch is scheduled for March 18th for VIPs and March 25th for non-VIPs, with a total of 300 P Nodes available. Each wallet can purchase a maximum of three P Nodes.

## P Node Operation and Rewards
The operation of P Nodes will be incentivized, with rewards based on three factors: the amount of storage space provided, the performance score, and the stake delegated to the node. The performance score will be calculated based on factors such as uptime, response time, and data integrity. Node operators will need to ensure their nodes are running smoothly and efficiently to maintain a high performance score.

## Staking and P Node Operation
Staking will play a crucial role in the P Node ecosystem, with users able to stake their Zan tokens to nodes. The Xandum Foundation may also offer stake to node operators, similar to the Solana Foundation. Node operators will need to balance their own staking needs with the need to attract stake from other users.

## Technical Requirements for P Node Operation
To operate a P Node, users will need a computer with at least 100 GB of storage, 2 GB of RAM, and a reliable internet connection. The node software will run on Ubuntu, and users will need to dedicate at least 64 GB of storage to the node.

## Dev Net and Test Net
The Xandum project will have a Dev Net and a Test Net, with the Dev Net serving as a testing ground for new features and updates. The Test Net will be used to test the stability and performance of the network, and will likely be incentivized to encourage participation.

## Upcoming Releases and Roadmap
The Xandum project has a number of upcoming releases and milestones, including the Fryberg release, the Munich release, and the launch of the Wikipedia alternative. The project is focused on building a decentralized storage layer, and will prioritize this goal over other features and functionality.

## Community Engagement and Support
The Xandum community is active and engaged, with many users participating in discussions on Discord and X. The project team encourages users to provide feedback and suggestions, and will prioritize building a strong and supportive community.

## P Node Purchase and Transfer
P Nodes can be purchased using Zan tokens, and users will need to transfer their tokens to a wallet in order to complete the purchase. The project team is exploring options for transferring P Nodes between wallets, but this feature is not currently available.

## Ledger Wallet Support
The Xandum project supports the use of Ledger wallets, and users can transfer their Zan tokens to a Ledger wallet in order to purchase a P Node.

## Withdrawal Process
The withdrawal process for P Node rewards is currently being developed, and the project team will provide more information on this topic in the future.

## X Spaces and Community Engagement
The Xandum project team is considering hosting X Spaces, which will allow users to engage with the team and each other in a more interactive and dynamic way. The team encourages users to provide feedback and suggestions on this topic.

## Conclusion
The P Node launch is an exciting milestone for the Xandum project, and marks an important step towards building a decentralized storage layer. The project team is focused on prioritizing this goal, and will work to build a strong and supportive community around the project. [Timestamp: 1:00:00]
