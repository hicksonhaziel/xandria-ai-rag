## Introduction to Xandeum
Xandeum is a project that aims to create a decentralized storage layer for blockchain applications. The team is building the project in public, with a roadmap that consists of 30 releases, partitioned into six eras. Each release is planned out, with the goal of creating a fully functional prototype by the end of the South era.

## The Six Eras of Xandeum
The six eras of Xandeum are:
1. Deep South

## Technical Components of Xandeum
The Xandeum project consists of several technical components, including:
* Atlas: a distributed database that keeps track of file paths and redundancy
* Pods: software that runs on provider nodes, connected to Atlas
* Xand Minor: an administrative interface for managing provider nodes
These components work together to provide a decentralized storage layer for blockchain applications.

## Community Involvement
The Xandeum team believes that community involvement is crucial to the success of the project. The team is building a community through social media channels and the Xandeum DAO, which will eventually take over governance of the project. The team encourages community members to participate in discussions, provide feedback, and contribute to the development of the project.

## Governance and Tokenomics
The Xandeum project has a unique tokenomics system, where 94% of fees go to provider nodes, and 4% go to the Xandeum DAO. The remaining 2% is reserved for the Xandeum Foundation, which will be used to fund development and marketing efforts. The team believes that this system will incentivize community members to participate in the project and contribute to its growth.
