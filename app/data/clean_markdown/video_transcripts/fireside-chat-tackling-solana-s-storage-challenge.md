## Introduction to Solana's Limitations
Solana has a very opinionated vision, with a focus on being a global state machine and blockchain at the speed of NASDAQ. However, this vision has limitations, both within the realm of the initial vision and in the horizontal direction, where there are opportunities for Solana to be more than its initial vision.

## Limitations within the Initial Vision
The global state machine and global price discovery are key aspects of Solana's vision. The global state is kept in Solana accounts, which are super fast and don't slow down the blockchain. However, these accounts don't scale with regards to storage capacity, with a size limitation of 8 megabytes. Storing one terabyte of data on Solana would cost around $1 billion in rent.

## Limitations in the Horizontal Direction
Solana's initial vision is not to be a file system or to store large amounts of data. However, with the growth of apps on Solana, storage is becoming a big issue. The accounts don't scale, and even within Solana's initial vision, storage is a limitation. Operating a validator on Solana also highlights the issue of storage, with snapshots of the global state growing in size and becoming unmanageable.

## Xandum's Solution
Xandum is adding a new tier of storage to Solana, which is not part of the initial vision. This new tier is designed to scale and provide a solution to the storage limitations on Solana. Xandum is not trying to replace Solana but rather fill in the gaps and provide a solution to the storage problem.

## The World Computer Metaphor
The world computer metaphor, which originated with Ethereum, refers to the idea of a decentralized computer that can run code and store data. However, this metaphor is incomplete, as it doesn't account for the lack of a disk or attached storage on the blockchain. Xandum is trying to complete this metaphor by providing a storage solution that allows developers to build applications that can store large amounts of data.

## Xandum's Approach
Xandum is using a set of provider nodes (PNoes) that do the actual heavy lifting of storage. These nodes can be chosen by the app, and the redundancy of the data can be decided by the app. This approach gives power back to the user and allows for more flexibility in terms of storage.

## Getting Involved with Xandum
People can find out more information about Xandum on their website, [xandum Network](https://xandum.network). They can also subscribe to the email list, join the Discord, and follow Xandum on social media to stay up to date. Running a PNoe is also an opportunity for people to get involved and help secure the network.

## Conclusion
Xandum is trying to solve the storage problem on Solana by providing a new tier of storage that scales and provides a solution to the limitations of Solana's accounts. This solution has the potential to empower developers to build applications that can store large amounts of data, making web 3 more ready for prime time.

## Next Steps
People can get involved with Xandum by running a PNoe, which is incentivized on the devnet and testnet. Once the mainnet is launched, anyone can run a PNoe and help secure the network. Xandum is also planning to trust anchor their database on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum and possibly Bitcoin, to provide a blockchain-grade trust anchor.
