## Introduction to Solana Limitations
Solana has a very opinionated vision, with a focus on being a global state machine and blockchain at the speed of NASDAQ. However, this vision has limitations, both within the realm of the initial vision and in the horizontal direction, where there are opportunities for Solana to be more than its initial intention.

## Limitations within the Initial Vision
The global state machine and global price discovery are key aspects of Solana's vision. The global state is kept in Solana accounts, which are super fast and don't slow down the blockchain. However, these accounts don't scale with regards to storage capacity, with a size limitation of 8 megabytes. Storing large amounts of data, such as one terabyte, would be extremely costly, around $1 billion in "rent" to create an account of that size.

## Limitations in Breadth
Solana's initial vision is not to create apps that have customer databases and store large amounts of data. This is where Xandum comes in, extending Solana's capabilities in the breadth dimension. Xandum is building a storage solution that will allow Solana to scale and support more applications.

## The Need for Storage Solutions
The more apps that are deployed on Solana, the more accounts are created, and the more storage is needed. This is becoming a problem, even within Solana's initial vision. Operating a validator on Solana, there is a concept called snapshots, which are a snapshot in time of all the global state of all accounts on Solana. These snapshots are growing in size, from a few hundred megabytes to 95 gigabytes, and will soon become unmanageable for validators.

## Xandum's Solution
Xandum is adding a whole new tier of storage, which will allow Solana to scale and support more applications. This storage layer will be separate from the Solana accounts, which will still be used for the global state machine. The provider nodes (PNoes) will do the actual heavy lifting of storage, and apps can decide what level of redundancy they need.

## The World Computer Metaphor
The world computer metaphor, which came up with the advent of Ethereum, is not fully applicable to blockchains. While we can run code on the blockchain (the CPU part of the computer) and store things in accounts (the RAM), we don't have a disk or attached storage, which is necessary for large-scale applications. Xandum is building this missing piece, allowing developers to build applications that can store large amounts of data and have databases.

## Demo Apps and Getting Involved
One of Xandum's key demo apps will be a decentralized version of Wikipedia, which will require a large amount of storage. To get involved with Xandum, people can visit the Xandum Network website, subscribe to their channels, and join their Discord. Running a PNoe is also an opportunity for individuals to contribute to the network and help secure the data of the world.

## Trust Anchoring and the Future of Web 3
Xandum will use trust anchoring, logging snapshots to several blockchains, including Ethereum and possibly Bitcoin, to ensure the integrity of the data. This will allow for a blockchain-grade, trust-anchored database of the world. With Xandum's solution, web 3 will finally be ready for prime time, empowering developers to build applications that they have wished to build for so long.
