## Introduction to Xandium
The Xandium farm is live, enabling users to trade the XAN token with other tokens. The farm provides extra rewards in the form of ZAN tokens, with an annual percentage yield of over 2,000%. This yield may fluctuate based on the total liquidity and trading activity.

The importance of liquidity is to allow users to trade XAN tokens without significant price impact. A huge price impact can occur when buying or selling large amounts of tokens.

## Providing Liquidity
To provide liquidity, users can deposit tokens into the standard pool on radium.io. The pool requires a 50/50 split of SOUL and ZAN tokens. Radium will assist users in determining the required amount of each token to deposit.

The Xandium team has locked over $140,000 in a streamflow contract for six months, demonstrating their trust in the project. Users are not required to lock their tokens, but doing so can help the community and increase the value of the ZEN token.

## Using Radium.io
To provide liquidity, users can follow these steps:
* Go to radium.io and navigate to the liquidity tab
* Select the standard pool and type "Z" to find the ZAN pool
* Deposit both SOUL and ZAN tokens in a 50/50 split
* Radium will assist in determining the required amount of each token

The current APY for providing liquidity is over 2,000%, with 8.8% coming from trading fees and the remainder from XAN rewards. The XAN rewards are not locked and are distributed immediately.

## Impermanent Loss
Impermanent loss occurs when the price of one token in the pool changes relative to the other. This can result in some tokens being sold and replaced with others. However, this is not a significant loss, as users are still providing liquidity and earning rewards.

[Timestamp: 20:00]
The Xandium team is encouraging users to provide liquidity to increase the overall liquidity of the pool. The goal is to reach $300,000 in liquidity within the next four weeks. Every contribution helps, and users will receive XAN rewards for participating.

## Conclusion
Providing liquidity to the Xandium pool on radium.io can earn users over 2,000% APY. The process is straightforward, and radium.io assists users in determining the required token amounts. The Xandium team is committed to the project and is encouraging users to participate in providing liquidity.
