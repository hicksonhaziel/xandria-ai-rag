## Introduction to Xandeum
Everybody is here with two wonderful people from Z, Bernie and Sean. The topic of discussion is Xandeum and its role in unlocking Web3's storage future. 

Bernie starts by introducing himself and explaining why he is working on Xandeum. He has been in blockchain and crypto since 2013, with a few years of hiatus. He got back into it in late 2021, building decentralized apps on Solana. However, he found it difficult to build meaningful apps due to storage limitations.

Solana accounts can store maybe a megabyte, which is not enough for real apps. This limitation makes it expensive and impossible to build apps that require more storage. Bernie believes that decentralization is essential for giving power to individuals and determining their own destiny.

## The Need for Decentralization
Decentralization is the reason blockchain and crypto exist. If it weren't for decentralization, we could use existing technologies like Visa. Bernie mentions a tweet from Elon Musk, saying that Web3 is more of a marketing gimmick, and he's right. We're not yet at the level of Web3 that we want to be.

Bernie asks if anyone can name a successful Web2 app that has been ported to Web3. The answer is no, which is surprising. This highlights the need for a storage layer to build real apps on blockchain.

## Sean's Background and Perspective
Sean introduces himself and explains that he's part of the Xandeum team. He believes that Web3 is currently like the beginning of the Web2 era, with just HTML and rich text. We need to make the storage layer more data-intensive to expand Web3.

Sean agrees that crypto and blockchain feel like they're stuck in Web1, with static content and limited functionality. We need to break through these barriers to build more meaningful apps.

## The Importance of Storage Layer
Bernie explains that the storage layer is the enabling technology needed to build decentralized apps. He draws an analogy with the development of artificial intelligence, which had a "Cambrian explosion" when artificial neural networks were introduced.

Similarly, blockchain needs a storage layer to spark a Cambrian explosion in decentralized apps. The current limitations of blockchain and smart contracts are due to the lack of a storage layer. Every computer has three components: CPU, RAM, and storage. We have the CPU and RAM, but not the storage.

## Conclusion
The storage layer is the missing piece needed to build real decentralized apps. Xandeum aims to provide this storage layer, enabling the development of more complex and data-intensive apps on blockchain.

The discussion will continue, covering how Xandeum plans to achieve this goal.
