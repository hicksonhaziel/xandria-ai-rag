## Introduction to pNodes
The pNodes are the provider nodes of the Xandum storage layer, which is necessary for making real decentralized apps. They provide the storage and are the core of that storage layer. The pNodes are smaller nodes that don't require a lot of memory or CPU, but they do need storage and a good internet connection.

## Why pNodes are Necessary
The reason pNodes are necessary is to reduce the redundancy of data storage from 3,000 to a much smaller number, making it more scalable. Currently, all data is stored on 3,000 validators, which is not efficient. With pNodes, apps can decide how much redundancy they need, and the pNodes will provide the necessary storage.

## Technical Requirements
The pNodes require storage and a good internet connection. They don't need a lot of memory or CPU, making them easier to manage. The Xandum team has created a graphical user interface called ZanMiner to make it easy to manage the pNodes.

## Community Aspect
The community is excited about the pNodes, and there are already many people who want to run them. The Xandum team wants to diversify who has the pNodes, so they are limiting the number of nodes per wallet. The community is essential to the success of the pNodes, and the team wants to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to participate.

## Cost Impact
The pNodes will have a significant impact on costs. By reducing the redundancy from 3,000 to a smaller number, the costs will be reduced by a factor of 1,000. Additionally, the pNodes will have lower hardware requirements, which will also reduce costs.

## Pricing Model
The pricing model for the pNodes will be community-driven and decentralized. The team will introduce fee markets to balance supply and demand. The fees will be determined by the market, and there will be middlemen who will sell futures contracts to provide predictability for users.

## Future Plans
The Xandum team plans to introduce regions and different fee models for different regions. They will also have encryption layers and optional layers on top of that. The first 300 pNodes will become available on March 25th, and the team will limit it to that number for the first era. The team wants to make sure that the pNodes are easy to use, so they have created a user-friendly interface.

## User Experience
The Xandum team wants to make sure that the pNodes are easy to use, even for non-technical people. They have created a graphical user interface that makes it easy to manage the pNodes. The team wants to make sure that the pNodes are intuitive and easy to use, just like an iPhone or a computer.
