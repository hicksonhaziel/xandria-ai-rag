## Introduction to the pNode Journey
The pNode journey begins on March 25th, 2025, when 300 pNodes will be available for purchase in the pNode store for 35,000 ZAND, which is less than $100. These pNodes will be part of the Deep South era, the first era of the xandum network. [Timestamp: 0:05]

## The Different Eras of the xandum Network
The xandum network will have several eras, including the Deep South era, the South era, the Mine era, and the Central era. Each era will bring new features and improvements to the network. The Mine era will be the first era on the mainnet, and it will be a minimum viable product. The Central era will focus on building out the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) between the pNodes, making the network more secure and resilient. [Timestamp: 10:00]

## Setting Up a pNode
To set up a pNode, users will need to have an Ubuntu server or a virtual private server (VPS) with low hardware requirements. The xandum team recommends using a VPS provider like Contabo, which offers a suitable VPS for $5.50 per month. Users will need to follow the documentation provided by the xandum team to set up their pNode, which will include downloading and installing the necessary software and configuring the pNode.

## Performance and Reputation Score
The performance and reputation score of a pNode will be based on several factors, including uptime, correctness of response, speed, latency, and transfer speed. The scoring criteria will evolve over time, and the community will have a say in defining what makes a good pNode. The xandum team will use a DAO governance model to allow the community to vote on changes to the network and the scoring criteria. [Timestamp: 30:00]

## Community Involvement and Governance
The xandum network will have a decentralized governance model, with a DAO that will allow the community to vote on changes to the network. The DAO will have a council that will oversee the governance process, but the community will have the final say. The xandum team will gradually give more power to the community over time, allowing them to make decisions about the network and its development. [Timestamp: 40:00]

## Getting Involved and Purchasing a pNode
To get involved and purchase a pNode, users will need to stay updated on the latest news and developments from the xandum team. They can do this by following the team on social media, joining the Discord channel, and signing up for the email list. The pNode store will open on March 25th, and users will be able to purchase pNodes using ZAND. [Timestamp: 50:00]

## Conclusion
The xandum network is an exciting new project that will allow users to participate in a decentralized network and earn rewards for providing storage and other services. The network will have a gradual rollout, with different eras and phases, and the community will have a say in its development and governance. Users can get involved by purchasing a pNode and participating in the network, and they can stay updated on the latest news and developments by following the xandum team on social media and joining the Discord channel.
