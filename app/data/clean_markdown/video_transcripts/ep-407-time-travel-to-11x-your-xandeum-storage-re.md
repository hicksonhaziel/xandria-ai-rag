## Introduction to Xandium
Xandium is the storage layer for the Salana blockchain, a fully smart contract native exabytes for Salana smart contracts. There have been four reward seasons, with each season lasting three months. The Xandium Foundation has prepared and paid out rewards through the DAO. However, the foundation is now handing over full responsibility for rewards payment to the DAO, which is governed by Xand token holders.

## Decentralization of Governance
The Xandium Foundation is handing over complete control to the DAO, which is a big step towards decentralization of governance. The storage layer itself is totally decentralized, comprising Xandium P nodes that make up the network. To participate in the DAO, users need to own XAN tokens, which can be bought on Jupiter.

## DAO Governance
The DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that allows token holders to govern the network and make decisions. The Xandium Foundation is making a big step by handing over control to the DAO, eliminating council votes and allowing community votes instead. This change will enable Xand token holders to vote for their own rewards and participate in the decision-making process.

## Conclusion
The Xandium network is undergoing significant changes, with the foundation handing over control to the DAO. This change will allow Xand token holders to participate in governance and vote for their own rewards. Users can buy XAN tokens on Jupiter and participate in the DAO to shape the future of the Xandium network.
