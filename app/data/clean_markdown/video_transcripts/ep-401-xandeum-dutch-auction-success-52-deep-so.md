## Introduction to Xandium
Xandium is the storage layer for the Sana blockchain, providing unlimited scalability in storage in a file system manner. The current version is 0.4, with version 0.5 and 0.6 in development. [Timestamp: 0:05]

## Xandium Version 0.5
Version 0.5, also known as the Engle stat release, will include simple metrics for monitoring P nodes, such as online status, response to heartbeat requests, and response to payload requests. P node owners will receive rewards, which will be paid automatically through a program. The owner-manager model will also be introduced, allowing P node owners to find managers to handle technical tasks in exchange for a cut of future storage income. [Timestamp: 10:00]

## Xandium Version 0.6
Version 0.6, also known as the Stoutgart release, will introduce redundancy, allowing multiple P nodes to store the same data. This will provide fault tolerance, ensuring that data is not lost if one P node fails. Each app can select its own redundancy level, and the Xandium network will monitor P nodes and replace faulty ones. [Timestamp: 20:00]

## Redundancy and Fault Tolerance
Redundancy will be achieved through erasure codes, which will allow data to be reconstructed from multiple P nodes. There are two types of fault tolerance: crash fault tolerance, which replaces faulty P nodes, and Byzantine fault tolerance, which resists malicious players. The Stoutgart release will include crash fault tolerance, while Byzantine fault tolerance will be implemented in later releases.

## P Node Rewards and Licensing
P node owners will receive rewards in the form of storage income, which will be boosted if they run a DevNet P node. Licenses for DevNet P nodes can be purchased, and owners will receive monthly rewards from the Zandium Foundation. [Timestamp: 30:00]

## Community and Development
The Xandium community is active, with a Discord channel available for support and discussion. The development team is working on finalizing the design steps for redundancy and implementing it in the Stoutgart release. A demo app will be unveiled soon, showcasing the storage layer's capabilities and bringing traffic and storage load to the Xandium network.

## Future Plans
The Xandium Foundation is based in the Cayman Islands, and the team is working on establishing a presence there. The foundation's director, Anthony, is already on the ground, and the team will be sharing updates and videos from the Cayman Islands soon. [Timestamp: 40:00]

## Conclusion
Xandium is making progress, with version 0.4 published and version 0.5 and 0.6 in development. The introduction of redundancy and fault tolerance will make the storage layer more robust, and the demo app will showcase its capabilities. The team is excited about the future of Xandium and the potential of the storage layer to provide a decentralized and scalable solution for data storage. [Timestamp: 50:00]
