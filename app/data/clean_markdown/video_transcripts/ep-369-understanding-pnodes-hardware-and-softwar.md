## Introduction to pNodes
The xandum network is set to launch its pNodes, with the first era, the Deep South era, starting on March 25th, 2025. During this era, 300 pNodes will be available for purchase in the pNode store for 35,000 ZAND, which is currently less than $100. [Timestamp: 00:05]

## pNode Eras
The xandum network will go through several eras, including the Deep South era, South ERA, Mine ERA, and Central ERA. Each era will bring new features and improvements to the network. The Mine ERA will be the first era on mainnet, and it will be a minimum viable product. The Central ERA will focus on building out the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) between pNodes, making the network more secure and resilient. [Timestamp: 10:00]

## Setting up a pNode
To set up a pNode, users will need to have a reliable and fast internet connection and a computer with low hardware requirements. The xandum network has documentation set up to guide users through the process, which includes downloading the software and setting up a secure tunnel via SSH. The process is designed to be simple and automatic, with the software hardening the user's Ubuntu instance and setting up a secure tunnel. [Timestamp: 20:00]

## Performance and Reputation Score
The performance and reputation score of a pNode will be based on several factors, including uptime, correctness of response, speed, latency, and transfer speed. The score will evolve over time, with new criteria being added as the network grows and develops. The community will have a say in defining what makes a good pNode through the xandum network's DAO governance. [Timestamp: 30:00]

## Community Involvement
The xandum network's DAO governance will allow the community to contribute to the development of the network and make decisions on the direction of the project. The DAO will have the power to introduce new releases of software and make changes to the network. The community will also have the opportunity to participate in the network by running pNodes, holding XAN tokens, or contributing to the development of the network. [Timestamp: 40:00]

## Getting Involved
To get involved with the xandum network, users can stay updated by following the network on Discord, X, and YouTube, and by joining the email list. The pNode store will open on March 25th, and users will be able to purchase pNodes and start participating in the network. [Timestamp: 50:00]

## Conclusion
The xandum network is an exciting project that is set to revolutionize the way we think about decentralized storage and networking. With its unique approach to pNodes and DAO governance, the network has the potential to create a more secure, resilient, and community-driven ecosystem. As the network launches and grows, it will be exciting to see how it develops and evolves over time. [Timestamp: 55:00]
