Drop your XIP ideas here.

After initial discussion, we will assign it a XIP number, create its own topic in the “XIPs” category and open discussion there, pre-Realms proposal.

Proposal to launch Orbit Mobile

A native Android DePIN application for Solana Mobile Seeker that enables users to contribute micro-storage capacity to the Xandeum network and earn XAND airdrop allocations. This leverages Seeker’s Genesis Token ecosystem, TEEPIN hardware attestation, and the Solana dApp Store 2.0 to expand Xandeum’s storage layer while rewarding mobile-first participants.

This initiative lowers the barrier to entry, expands Xandeum’s community, and validates mobile-first DePIN infrastructure while rewarding users for their contributions.

It’s also a step to further the Analysis dashboard I worked on for the Xandeum pNodes, I think it’s a great idea, and would love to hear what you guys think.

Reach out: Heisjoel0x on X, or just reply here.

Solana Mobile Seeker

I think involvement on the Solana Mobile Seeker network could be useful. They have an active discord page. Primarily I think we want to push usability and we may end up just acquiring stagnant wallets which where people are speculating on the price of xand.
