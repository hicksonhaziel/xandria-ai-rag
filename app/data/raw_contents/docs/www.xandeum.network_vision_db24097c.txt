We spark the Cambrian Explosion in Web3 dApps - by giving them a scalable storage layer that solves the Blockchain Storage Trilemma.

 

In other words - we’re pushing the evolution of blockchain technology to its third stage.

Earth

Big Bang

The beginning of blockchain: Bitcoin was created.

Dawn Of Life

The first forms of life emerge. With Ethereum’s birth, the blockchain became programmable and thus dApps could evolve.

Cambrian Explosion

Blockchain’s Cambrian Explosion, driven by Xandeum’s storage layer. It captures the dynamic burst of innovation, where traditional Web2 apps evolve into storage-enabled Web3 apps, and entirely new forms of decentralized applications emerge.
