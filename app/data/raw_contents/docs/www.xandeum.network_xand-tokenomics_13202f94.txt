Tokenomics

Community DAO: 

The community DAO treasury will be used to build a large Xandeum community, specifically stakers, storage providers, validators, and dApp developers. Additionally, it will be used for community grants, the staking rewards season payouts, and liquidity providers.

Community building: 

These funds will be spent to grow our community, e.g. via KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders), advertising, and community management services.

Ecosystem development: 

Pay for small development tasks that add to our ecosystem, like analytics tools etc. Incentives for referrals to devs, and similar things.

Community Grants: 

Reserved for projects that the Foundation wants and offers grants for teams to implement.

Staking rewards: 

These can be used in rewards seasons to issue XAND rewards to our liquid stakers

Liquidity Providers: 

Used to offer additional incentives in XAND to provide liquidity for XAND on DEXes.

XANDC Holders: 

Our earliest investors, supporters, and believers receive the option to upgrade their XANDC tokens to XAND one-for-one. 50% of these tokens will be available on October 29, the rest will vest linearly over 12 months.

Team: 

The team allocation is intended as an incentive for current and future team members. There is a 12-month cliff and vesting linearly over 36 months.

AirDrops: 

The Xandeum Foundation is planning on 5 airdrops. In the first airdrop, claim 50% right away, and the other 50% will vest linearly over 12 months. Qualification requirements, tasks, and themes may change for each airdrop.

​Foundation Reserve: 

The Foundation reserve will be used for future acquihires and strategic partnerships to build the storage layer and grow the Xandeum ecosystem. We will also get market makers on board and ramp up marketing operations.

Market makers: 

These tokens can be loaned to market makers to enhance liquidity both on DEXes as well as CEXes.

Strategic acquihires/partnerships: 

Acquisitions (or joint ventures) of small companies/teams.

Building the storage layer: 

These funds will be used place orders with development companies to build the storage layer.

Marketing Operations: 

Day to day marketing tasks to be performed by the development company or marketing subcontractors

 

XAND Utility
The XAND governance token can be used to vote and set up vote proposals in the Xandeum DAO.

Example vote proposals: Changes to the delegation strategy of the Xandeum Pool, adjustments to the rewards distribution of the Xandeum Pool, or how to use the DAO treasury to grow the Xandeum  ecosystem.
The XAND token is more than just a digital asset; it's your key to actively participating in the Xandeum Network's Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). By holding XAND tokens, you become a vital part of the decision-making process that shapes the future of our ecosystem.
Governance of the DAO:
Our DAO is the heart of Xandeum, giving control directly to the community. As a XAND token holder, you have the authority to:

Update Network Code: Propose and vote on updates to all components of the Xandeum Network, including both the storage-enabled liquid staking solution and the scalable storage layer.

Modify Critical Parameters: Adjust commission rates and other essential settings to optimize network performance and sustainability.

Control the Treasury: Oversee the DAO treasury where all commissions and fees are accumulated, ensuring transparent and democratic fund allocation.


Read the DAO Constitution
 

Complete Community Control:
All value generated within the Xandeum Network flows directly into the DAO treasury

Storage-Enabled Liquid Staking Commissions: Earnings from our innovative staking solution are funneled back into the DAO.

Storage Transaction Fees: Once our scalable storage layer is live, fees from storage-enabled transactions will also contribute to the treasury.

There are no backdoors or hidden mechanisms siphoning value away. The DAO—and therefore the XAND token holders—have exclusive control over these funds, solidifying a truly decentralized and community-driven network.
Why XAND Matters:
By participating in the DAO with your XAND tokens, you

Shape the Network's Future: Have a direct say in the evolution and governance of Xandeum.

Benefit Economically: Influence how treasury funds are utilized, potentially impacting rewards and network improvements.

Promote Decentralization: Support a model where users, not corporations, hold the power.

A Network Owned by Its Users:
Our approach ensures that the Xandeum Network is governed transparently and democratically

Code Authority: The DAO can update all network components, keeping us adaptable and secure.

Financial Oversight: Token holders manage the treasury, promoting responsible and beneficial use of resources.

Long-Term Vision: This model captures all value generated by the network in perpetuity, aligning everyone's interests toward sustained success.


How to participate in DAO governance with XAND
To participate in DAO governance, holders must lock their XAND on the Xandeum Realms governance platform. Locked XAND is subject to a 30-day unlocking period which begins once the unlock is initiated. XAND holders cannot vote during this period. Anyone with locked XAND above the minimum threshold <tbd> can send proposals on chain and execute them if passed.
 

XAND Earn Season
At the launch of the Xandeum Pool, one season will be 3 months long. XAND is accumulated by staking SOL and holding xandSOL. The more quantity, and the longer duration xandSOL is held, the larger the XAND rewards allocation at the end of the season. Rewards will be paid out at the end of the season, however stakers will be able to see their accrued rewards in real-time in their rewards dashboard.
Claim rules: Claim will be 100%? (No vesting?) At the end of the season stakers have 3 months to claim their XAND rewards before those will be clawed back into the Xandeum Pool DAO treasury. 
 

XAND Incentives
We love our early adopters! To show our appreciation, the sooner you stake with us, the bigger your XAND reward boost will be! Here's how it works. We have 4 distribution phases, and as the pool grows in size of SOL staked, the phases progress. In the early stages, the XAND emission of the pool is boosted by up to 10x the standard distribution. Future changes to the distribution model can be affected by the DAO
 

Here are the phases
Hyperdrive Stage (Pool <= 30,000 SOL): 10x XAND Rewards! Be among the first pioneers and get a massive boost to your XAND earnings.
Launchpad Stage (Pool <= 250,000 SOL): 4x XAND Rewards! Join us early on our journey and claim a significant XAND bonus.
Liftoff Stage (Pool <= 1,000,000 SOL): 2x XAND Rewards! Stake early and enjoy an impactful XAND reward boost.
Cruising Altitude Stage (Pool > 1,000,000 SOL): 1x XAND Rewards! Even after the initial stages, staking remains highly rewarding.
 

Where to get the XAND token
XAND is available for trading on leading Solana DEXs. It can be earned by staking SOL in the Xandeum Pool and claiming it at the end of each season. If you qualify for any Xandeum Foundation airdrop, you’ll be able to claim XAND in the claim portal.
