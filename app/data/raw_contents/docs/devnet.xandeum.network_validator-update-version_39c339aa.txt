Restart your validator

If everyting looks good, restart your validator while delinquincy is below 10% and monitor until it is caught back up to the chain.

If you have the system service set to restart=always , then you can use the validator exit command. The validator will restart as soon as it creates a snapshot and stops.

Bash
1
agave-validator --ledger ~/ledger exit --max-delinquent-stake 10 --min-idle-time 0 --monitor
