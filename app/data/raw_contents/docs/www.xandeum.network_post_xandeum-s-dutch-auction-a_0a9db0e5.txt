Xandeum’s recent milestones mark significant strides in decentralized storage for Solana. The Dutch Auction, launched on September 6, 2025, which sold out 52 Deep South Era pNodes in just 34 hours, raising $200,000 for the Xandeum Foundation. Concurrently, the Herrenberg release, now live, introduces powerful features that enhance pNode functionality and set the stage for scalable, data-intensive dApps. This blog post delves into the auction’s success and the transformative capabilities of Herrenberg, offering insights for pNode operators and developers alike, complete with links to explore further.





Dutch Auction: A Resounding Success



The Dutch Auction, hosted on pnodestore.xandeum.network, began at 19:00 UTC on September 6, 2025, with the start time chosen via the DutchDecider app, where community members bid as little as 0.20 USDC to ensure global accessibility. Selling 52 Deep South Era pNodes—up from 49 due to additional allocations—the event raised $134,000 in USDC and $60,000 in XAND, concluding 14 hours early on September 10. Each pNode came with a DevNet license and a unique 3D-rendered NFT to boost Storage Income (STOINC).




Mechanics and Timeline: Prices dropped every 30 minutes over a planned 48 hours, with bids requiring USDC and XAND. The first pNode sold in 5 seconds at $4,900 USDC + 490,000 XAND. Titan NFTs (11x multiplier) saw ~20 sales at $4,410, including 10 by one wallet. Dragon NFTs (5x multiplier) sold at $1,538, Coyotes (3x multiplier) at $942–$981, and Rabbits (1.5x multiplier) at $577–$601, with all pNodes gone by 05:00 UTC.

Impact: The auction’s rapid sell-out reflects strong community confidence, creating a diverse pNode operator base poised to earn STOINC. Learn more at Xandeum.network/stoinc.




This success funds Xandeum’s vision, with pNode operators gaining access to the DevNet and the Xandeum Foundation Delegation Program. Setup guides are at Xandeum.network/docs.





Herrenberg Release: Elevating pNode Capabilities



The Herrenberg release, now live, builds on the Munich release’s .txt file hosting prototype, introducing advanced features to Xandeum’s storage layer. Designed to empower developers and pNode operators, Herrenberg enhances the infrastructure for sedApps (storage-enabled dApps), paving the way for mainnet by late 2025. Key features include:




PRPC Interface: Herrenberg equips pNodes with a Remote Procedure Call (PRPC) interface, enabling seamless interaction with Solana’s blockchain. This allows pNodes to handle storage requests efficiently, integrating with smart contracts via Xandeum Web3.js, a developer-friendly layer atop Solana’s Web3.js. This simplifies building data-intensive dApps, from social platforms to AI governance tools.




Gossip Protocol: A new gossip protocol enables pNodes to communicate and share status updates, forming a decentralized network. This ensures robust data distribution and availability, with validator nodes (vNodes) overseeing integrity using cryptographic verification.




Crude Search Capabilities: Herrenberg introduces basic search functionality, allowing users to query and retrieve data from Xandeum buckets—scalable, file-system-like storage units. This enhances sedApp usability, enabling applications like decentralized research hubs or content platforms to access data with low latency.




Community-Driven Analytics Platform: The gossip protocol lays the groundwork for a pNode analytics platform, to be developed by the community. This will provide insights into pNode performance and network health, with project details forthcoming on Xandeum.network.




These features make Herrenberg a critical step toward a minimum viable product (MVP), supporting pNode operators and developers in testing and optimizing the network. Join the discussion on Xandeum’s Discord to contribute to the analytics platform.





What This Means for pNode Operators and Developers



pNode Operators: Your Deep South Era pNode unlocks DevNet testing and eligibility for XAND stake via the Delegation Program. Maintain performance (heartbeats every 30 seconds, storage responses) to maximize credits and STOINC, amplified up to 176x with Titan NFTs. Secure your pNode by disabling SSH password login and using a non-standard port (not 22); see Xandeum.network/docs.




Developers: Herrenberg’s RPC interface and search capabilities simplify building sedApps, leveraging Xandeum buckets for exabyte-scale storage. The gossip protocol ensures reliable data access, ideal for data-heavy applications.





Looking Ahead



The auction’s $200,000 fuels Xandeum’s roadmap:




Engold Release (2–3 Weeks): Tracks pNode credits for 10,000 XAND/month DevNet rewards.




Stodgard Release: Adds redundancy for mainnet launch by late 2025, enabling SOL-based STOINC.




Future Sales: A potential Dutch Auction near mainnet will offer South Era pNodes with a lower boost (e.g., 7x vs. 16x).




The auction and Herrenberg position Xandeum to scale Solana’s storage, potentially reaching Filecoin’s 30-exabyte capacity with $15M/day in fees (94% to operators). Stay updated on Xandeum’s X.
