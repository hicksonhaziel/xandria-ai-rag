Xandeum Storage Income (STOINC) and Rewards Overview

This page explains how you can earn Rewards and Storage Income (STOINC) by participating in the Xandeum Devnet. Whether you're running nodes or moderating our community, there are exciting opportunities to contribute and earn. THIS IS A DRAFT THAT WILL BE REVISED MULTIPLE TIMES.

 

1. Rewards Program

 

The Rewards Program supports those who help keep the Xandeum Devnet running smoothly. Rewards are paid in locked XAND tokens and are funded by the Xandeum Foundation.

 

Reward Structure

- Validator Node Operators: Earn 10,000 XAND per month for running a validator node.

- pNode Operators: Earn 10,000 XAND per month for running a pNode.

- Discord Moderators: Earn 40,000 XAND per month for moderating our Discord community.

 

2. Storage Income (STOINC)

 

STOINC (Storage Income) is the revenue you can earn by running pNodes, funded by fees from sedApps (storage-enabled dApps). In the future, these fees could become substantial income for pNode owners.

 

STOINC Distribution

Fees from sedApps are split as follows:

- 94% goes to pNode operators.

- 3% goes to the XAND DAO.

- 3% goes to Xandeum Preferred Investors.

 

 

​

How STOINC is Calculated

Your STOINC depends on storageCredits, calculated every epoch (~2 days) based on four factors:

 

For a wallet owning a certain number of pNodes, providing a total amount of storage space (in GB), with a network-measured performance score (from 0 to 1), and a certain amount of XAND staked, the formula is:

 

​

​

​

​

Key Factors Explained

1. Number of pNodes: Owning more pNodes multiplies your rewards. For example, two pNodes providing 50GB each          earn twice as much as one pNode providing 100GB.

2. Storage Space: More storage capacity directly increases rewards (e.g., twice the space = twice the rewards).

3. Performance Score: A score (0 to 1) based on your pNode’s reliability and performance.

4. Stake: The amount of XAND you stake influences rewards proportionally.

​

Important: If any factor is 0 in an epoch, you earn no rewards for that epoch.

 

Buying more pNodes increases your STOINC proportionally, so purchasing multiple pNodes early is a smart move!

 

Boost Factors

Boost factors increase your storageCredits, boosting your STOINC. Each pNode has a boost factor (1 or higher), and the overall boost is calculated using a geometric mean if you own multiple pNodes.

 

The formula for boostedCredits is:

 

​

​

​

​

​

 

Example

For a wallet with 3 pNodes and 100,000 storageCredits:

- pNode 1: Boost factor = 1.5 (50% boost)

- pNode 2: Boost factor = 1 (no boost)

- pNode 3: Boost factor = 2 (100% boost)

 

boostedCredits = 100,000 × (1.5 × 1 × 2)^(1/3) ≈ 100,000 × 1.44225 = 144,225

 

This gives a 44.225% average boost across the pNodes.

 

Early purchases and high-boost NFTs significantly increase your earnings!

 

Ways to Earn Boost Factors

Boost factors come from NFTs or pNode purchase eras:

 

NFTs

- XENO NFT: 1.1 (10% boost)

- Titan NFT: 11 (1,000% boost)

- Dragon NFT: 4 (300% boost)

- Coyote NFT: 2.5 (150% boost)

- Rabbit NFT: 1.5 (50% boost)

- Cricket NFT: 1.1 (10% boost)

 

pNode Purchase Eras

- DeepSouth Era: 16 (1,500% boost)

- South Era: 10 (900% boost)

- Main Era: 7 (600% boost)

- Coal Era: 3.5 (250% boost)

- Central Era: 2 (100% boost)

- North Era: 1.25 (25% boost)

 

Final STOINC Calculation

Your STOINC for an epoch is calculated as:

 

 

 

​

 

Where:

- total fees: All storage fees (in SOL) collected from sedApps in the epoch.

- pNode share: The share of fees for pNodes (e.g., 0.94 for 94%).

- total boostedCredits: The sum of boostedCredits across all pNode-owning wallets.

 

This ensures you receive a fair share of the epoch’s fees based on your boostedCredits.

 

Key Takeaways

- Rewards (locked XAND) are paid to validator nodes, pNode operators, and Discord moderators, funded by the Xandeum Foundation.

- STOINC (in SOL) comes from sedApp fees and is distributed to pNode operators based on the STODIST formula.

- Storage Credits depend on the number of pNodes, storage space, performance score, and stake.

- Boost Factors from NFTs or early pNode purchases can significantly increase your earnings.

Early investment in pNodes and high-boost NFTs maximizes your STOINC, with top pNodes potentially earning substantial income.
