Hello Xandeum community! Blockchain Bernie just went live from Germany with a big update on Airdrop 2, the points system, and everything that’s coming next. Here is a clear, easy-to-read summary of the most important news.



1. Airdrop 2 Snapshot is DONE

Snapshot taken on November 19, 2025

Total points collected: approximately 226 million

The team is now reviewing for cheating (empty wallets, fake referrals, etc.)

Suspicious allocations will be temporarily held (same process as Airdrop 1). Users get 6–8 weeks to prove legitimacy. Any unclaimed suspicious rewards will later be redistributed to honest participants.



2. Airdrop 3 is ALREADY LIVE!

Start earning points for Airdrop 3 today

Visit points.xandeum.network → connect wallet → complete tasks

New bonus: joining the official Xandeum Discord now gives extra points. The goal is to grow from ~4,000 members to 10,000+ very soon.



3. Upcoming DAO Proposal for Airdrop 2 (60 million $XAND total)

A DAO proposal will be published very soon (expected early next week). The suggested split is three equal parts of 20 million $XAND each:

Part

	

Who gets it

	

Purpose




1

	

Point earners (classic tasks)

	

Reward everyone who liked, retweeted, watched videos, referred friends, etc.




2

	

Developers building storage-enabled dApps on Xandeum

	

Bounties (USDC + $XAND) for useful tools such as pNode analytics, StakeWiz-style dashboards, etc. via the new SuperTeam Pro platform launching next week.




3

	

Content creators & influencers

	

Rewards for high-quality videos and posts that bring real new users (minimum reach required).

$XAND holders decide everything. Anyone can create a competing proposal by gathering ~5–6 million $XAND (owned or delegated).



4. Fairer Distribution Using the Square-Root Formula

To reward smaller honest participants more fairly, points will go through the square-root formula before final shares are calculated (already used successfully by Jupiter, Marinade, and other large Solana projects).

Example:

User A: 1,000,000 points → square root = 1,000

User B: 1,000 points → square root ≈ 31.6 Instead of a 1,000× difference, the big user only gets ~32× more. Big earners still come out on top, but genuine smaller contributors get a meaningful boost.



5. Proposed Vesting Schedule

4-month cliff (you’ll see your allocation but can’t claim yet)

Then linear vesting over 12 months This protects the token price until Mainnet and real utility are live.



6. Other Quick Updates

Season 4 staking rewards (XAND staking & liquid staking) → DAO proposal coming in the next few days

Brand-new documentation live at xandeum.network/docs – feedback welcome!

Major releases in the next few weeks: Ingolstadt v0.5 (pNode metrics), Stuttgart release (redundancy), pNode–NFT assignment portal, and more

SuperTeam Pro bounties launch next week – builders can earn USDC + $XAND



What You Can Do Right Now

Earn Airdrop 3 points at points.xandeum.network

Join Discord and stay active (big point bonus!)

Developers & creators: prepare for SuperTeam bounties

Everything is 100 % community-governed via the DAO. The team only proposes – $XAND holders make the final call.

Thank you for being part of Xandeum. Many more exciting updates are coming very soon!
