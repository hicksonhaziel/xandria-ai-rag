Update your server

Run as sudo / root user

Reboot if you have a new kernel installed during the update that needs loaded.

Bash
1
sudo -s &&

﻿
Bash
1
apt-get update -y && apt upgrade

﻿
Stop old system service

Use  status to check if its running, stop to stop the service, and disable to prevent it from loading next reboot

Bash
1
systemctl status xand.service

2
systemctl disable xand.service

3
systemctl stop xand.service

﻿
SSH Keys

If you want to make a new user sol to match the new guide, then make sure your ssh keys to login remotly are stored in your home dir for sol or root users (not only in xand home dir. Careful with the ssh keys...if you remove them you could lock yourself out of your server...

Check for keys in root

Bash
1
sudo cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

﻿

Check for keys in xand

Bash
1
su xand

﻿
Bash
1
cd ~

2
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

﻿

Copy from xand and append to root keys file

Bash
1
sudo -i

﻿
Bash
1
sudo cat /home/xand/.ssh/authorized_keys >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

﻿
Validator Keypairs

Make sure you have copied your validator keypairs if they are needed for the new server.

Otherwise they can be created new during install of the validator software. 

There is no reason to re-use the old one, only personal preferance.

Remove xand user account

Once you have sucessfully logged into your server using either root or sol user, and copied/backed up any files you need, you may wish to remove everything from xand user and their files.

Bash
1
sudo -s

﻿
Bash
1
userdel -rf xand

﻿
