The DAO proposal for a temporary moratorium on future airdrops (Airdrop 3 and beyond) has successfully passed as of December 25, 2025. Voting results indicate 65.5% in favor (approximately 17.95 million XAND votes) for pausing airdrops pending a strategic review, against 34.5% opposed (about 9.45 million votes). This outcome reflects a clear community preference for data-driven token distribution strategies, requiring Xandeum Directors to demonstrate positive correlations between airdrop campaigns and XAND price stability before resuming.

Key elements of the moratorium include:

Halting all “Airdrop 3+” events until empirical evidence supports their efficacy.

Mandating third-party verification and business cases for any future proposals.

Aligning with broader blockchain governance trends toward sustainability and value protection, as seen in evolving DeFi protocols.

While vote has concluded, this forum thread remains the ideal space for ongoing dialogue. Insights on implementation, potential metrics for review, or comparisons to similar measures in other Solana-based projects would advance the conversation.

For reference, the full proposal details are available here.
