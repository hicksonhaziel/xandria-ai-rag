How To Setup a Xandeum DevNet Validator

NOTE: This guide shows commands for text editors nano and vim. A quick search can find a guide or video to operate these text editors more efficiently and make your life easier.

﻿


﻿

1) Update and setup our user

Start with a fresh instance of Linux as the root user. 

These instructions use Ubuntu Server 22.04.2LTS﻿

BEFORE YOU CONTINUE!

Make sure you see your entire drive space as available!
Use df -h to see your free space. You want to see that you have all your space in a free partition. Ubuntu will want to default to 100g LVM. The preferance is to eliminate LVM and Raid and use all available space for your / mount point. If you don't show all your disk space, run the Ubuntu installer again and pay attention to the storage section.

﻿


Get root user

Run as sudo or root user. If you don't have access to the root user, then you will need to prepend all your requests in this section with sudo. 

Notice in the screenshot below I start as user solchange to root user then back to sol. 

Root user has ALL the privledges and won't require sudo. But some items NEED to be ran as the sol user (ie rust install, validator build, etc)

Use sudo -i to change to root user and exit to end root user

﻿

Update your installation

CLI
1
sudo apt-get update -y && 

2
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

﻿

Install a few apps

CLI
1
sudo apt install -y bzip2 vnstat

﻿
CLI
1
sudo systemctl enable --now vnstat

﻿

﻿


Create Xandeum Validator User Account

Skip creating a user if you already have it

﻿


CLI
1
sudo adduser sol

﻿

Enter a password and accept defaults to the following questions:

New password:
 Retype new password:
 passwd: password updated successfully
 Changing the user information for xand
 Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Full Name []:
        Room Number []:
        Work Phone []:
        Home Phone []:
        Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n] y

﻿


Add new user to sudo group

CLI
1
sudo usermod -aG sudo sol

﻿

Change to the New User account

CLI
1
su sol

﻿

﻿


Switch the Xand home directory. 

NOTE: If you log in as root and switch to sol it will bring you into the /root dir!
So use cd ~ to get to home dir each time you log in!

﻿


CLI
1
cd ~

﻿

Test switching between root user and xand user

Note: When you are root user, your line starts with root and when you are sol user the line starts with sol

﻿


CLI
1
sudo -i

﻿
CLI
1
exit

﻿
﻿
﻿
2) Choose which release you want to install

Go to the Xandeum Binaries repo and download the tar.bz2 file to your server.
This guide is using version v2.2.0-xandeum_c9b4b31d but check for newer releases.
You can right-click on the file name to copy the download link.
https://github.com/Xandeum/binaries/releases﻿

﻿

Set the version and filename variables

Text
1
ver="v2.2.0-xandeum_b5f66263"

2
file="v2.2.0-xandeum_b5f66263.tar.gz"

3
echo -e "\n"

4
echo version=$ver;

5
echo filename=$file

6
echo -e "\n"

﻿
CLI
1
cd ~

2
wget https://github.com/Xandeum/binaries/releases/download/$ver/$file

﻿

Create the needed bin folder

CLI
1
mkdir ~/.local/share/xandeum/install/releases/$ver -p

﻿

Extract the file into the new bin dir

Add a directory for connection info

CLI
1
sudo mkdir -p /var/run/xandeum && chown sol:sol /var/run/xandeum && chmod 755 /var/run/xandeum

﻿

Test a binary by running it in the local folder

CLI
1
cd ~/.local/share/xandeum/install/releases/$ver/bin

﻿
CLI
1
./agave-validator -V

﻿
﻿

Remove downloaded file if binaries are working

CLI
1
rm ~/$file

﻿
Set our symlink, PATH, and some convenient aliases

Set a symlink from our new release to the active_release folder we will use in our $PATH later. (This command removes an old symlink to active_release if it exists)

CLI
1
rm /home/sol/.local/share/xandeum/install/releases/active_release

2
ln -sf /home/sol/.local/share/xandeum/install/releases/$ver/bin /home/sol/.local/share/xandeum/install/releases/active_release

﻿

Backup the old $PATH for reference.

CLI
1
echo $PATH >> ~/PATH.bak

﻿

Using your favorite editor to open the bashrc config:

nano
vim
1
vim ~/.bashrc

﻿

Add the following lines at the very bottom and save your changes and exit.

text
1
export PATH="/home/sol/.local/share/xandeum/install/releases/active_release:$PATH"

2
alias l="ls -a --color=auto"

3
alias ll="ls -alh --color=auto"

4
alias sv="solana validators --sort skip-rate --reverse"

5
alias sg="solana gossip"

6
alias se="solana epoch-info"

7
alias sb="solana balance"

﻿
CLI
1
source ~/.bashrc

﻿
Check your Install of the software

As sol user, time to test if everything worked.

CLI
1
cd ~

2
agave-validator -V

﻿
Check Xandeum Software Version:
Results should appear simlar to the following (check for correct version and src)
﻿

﻿


﻿
﻿

3) Configure your validator instance.

Please observe proper security of your private keys! 

MainNet Keys should be created on a secure machine, not an unknown remote machine.

Record your 12 words (and bip39 passphrase) in a safe spot. For DevNet it's not critical if you lose them...but if on MainNet, losing the keys equals LOST FUNDS. There is no recovering from lost keys.

For MainNet, your withdraw authority key should never be on your machine!

﻿


Generate your 3 DevNet keys.

NOTE: If you already have created keys on this machine from the previous install, 
DON'T CREATE NEW ONES!
Skip to Switch to Xandeum Cluster instead.

﻿


You can leave the  bip39 passphrase empty (only applies to DevNet/TesNet since it is not real money).
Your 12 words and pubkey are shown immediatly after the prompt for bip39 passphrase.
Take note of the public key it provides you (copy it down). It will help us help you should there be an issue.

Run as sol user!

﻿


CLI
1
cd ~

﻿

Create your3 keys...note down all 3 keyphrases before you continue on.

CLI
1
solana-keygen new -o ~/validator-keypair.json

2
solana-keygen new -o ~/vote-keypair.json

3
solana-keygen new -o ~/withdraw-keypair.json

﻿

To view your public key later

CLI
1
solana-keygen pubkey ~/validator-keypair.json

﻿

View your current configuration information

CLI
1
solana config get

﻿
Switch to Xandeum cluster
CLI
1
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.xandeum.com:8899

﻿
Set your new keypair to be used by default.
CLI
1
solana config set --keypair ~/validator-keypair.json

﻿
Testing our work so far.
Check your connecrtion to the cluster
Linux
1
solana gossip

﻿
Request an airdrop from the Xand Faucet
CLI
1
solana airdrop 1 ~/validator-keypair.json

﻿

Do this again 4 more times. (We are also giving you fake SOL tokens to get started.)

There is a daily limit per wallet...These tokens on TestNet/DevNet are not real.
Check your wallet balance.
CLI
1
solana balance

﻿

You should have ~5 tokens present if you do it 5x's.

﻿


Create your vote account.
Submit a transaction on the blockchain setting up your vote account
CLI
1
solana create-vote-account --commission 0 ~/vote-keypair.json ~/validator-keypair.json ~/withdraw-keypair.json

﻿

To find your Vote Account Pubkey later, use:

CLI
1
solana-keygen pubkey ~/vote-keypair.json

﻿
﻿
﻿

4) Configure your Start Script Configuration
Create your validator configuration file using your editor
nano
vim
1
vim ~/validator-start.sh

﻿
There will be nothing in here, so copy and paste in the following configurations. Save and Exit.

﻿

Note: Every trailing \ is important!
Any commented lines # must be at the bottom of the script. This is to save a command that may be needed later but not used now.

Note: Change the location of ledger in the script to your second drive if you aren't using raid0

Here are the known-validators:

xand-1 9HKXdh8Veb278efwgPjsRkQtyJEGhyGP8vkbCSmp4HgR
xand-2 DiEyTNni4uPwXaj9AX4pvFWvYFY5FKLEo3RRgN6Q22Lc

xand-4 5PW1SsXftQqKLF9FU88898BMG1vv3tqYRrVkGkFRwobs
xand-5 G6x4w89TJA9oDBSRNcpeanaThqBUJbEv5DJRBZGrQHYV





﻿


Make the script you just made executable.
CLI
1
chmod a+x ~/validator-start.sh

﻿
﻿
﻿

5) System Tuning

Run as root user, use sudo -i

﻿


Optimize sysctl knobs (copy block and paste into teminal, press return)

CLI
1
sudo bash -c "cat >/etc/sysctl.d/21-agave-validator.conf <<EOF

2
# Increase UDP buffer sizes

3
net.core.rmem_default = 134217728

4
net.core.rmem_max = 134217728

5
net.core.wmem_default = 134217728

6
net.core.wmem_max = 134217728

7


8
# Increase memory mapped files limit

9
vm.max_map_count = 2000000

10


11
# Increase number of allowed open file descriptors

12
fs.nr_open = 2000000

13
EOF"

﻿
CLI
1
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/21-agave-validator.conf

﻿

Open the file /etc/systemd/system.conf in your editor

nano
vim
1
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system.conf

﻿

Add the following to the [Manager] section. Save and exit.

CLI
1
DefaultLimitNOFILE=2000000

﻿

Reload the daemon

CLI
1
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

﻿

Increase process file desriptor count limit. (copy block and paste into teminal, press return)

CLI
1
sudo bash -c "cat >/etc/security/limits.d/90-agave-nofiles.conf <<EOF

2
# Increase process file descriptor count limit

3
* - nofile 2000000

4
EOF"

﻿

This section is complete. Exit all shells or reboot to activate changes!
