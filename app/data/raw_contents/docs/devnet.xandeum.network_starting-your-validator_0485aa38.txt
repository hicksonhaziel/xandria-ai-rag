There are two methods to start your validator. 

Only run one method or the other. If you have followed the guide, then proceed to option 2 below to start as a background service.

1) Manual 

Manual will require you to keep the terminal window open or use a terminal multiplexor (tmux) as the validatator will die if the window closes.

﻿


Run the exec file from the home dir 

CLI

cd ~

CLI

./validator-start.sh

2) System Service (Auto)

The service will run in the background and will auto start 1 second after the system reboots. 

NOTE: complete the section Setup System Service
﻿
 first.

Run as sudo or root user

Enable the service to run in auto

CLI

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

2
sudo systemctl enable --now validator.service

﻿
