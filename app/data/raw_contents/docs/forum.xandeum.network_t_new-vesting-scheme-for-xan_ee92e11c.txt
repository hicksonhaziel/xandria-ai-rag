Xandonians,

The vesting schedule for XAND converted from XANDC has been an object of discussion for some time.

We have been looking into our initial circulating supply, and the growth of circulating supply in the first 12 months. If we keep XANDC holders at 0% initially, we will release 400M XAND into circulating supply in the first 12 months, leading to increased pressure on the token price.

Our new proposal is to have the XANDC vesting schedule idential to the airdrop, i.e. 50% vesting immediately and the other 50% vesting linearly over 12 months.

Staking XAND is still an option that can be discussed at a future DAO proposal, as it needs some time to implement.

Please let us know what you think about this change.

Its a good compromise. Staking XAND is a great way to support the ecosystem too especially if you are not flush with funds enough to partake in a liquidity pool.

A LP would be another option too which would help stabilize pricing too.

We don’t want the price to plummet right after the introduction, so

My opinion is that it would be good that now, at TGE, as few tokens as possible enter circulation. XANDC holders are people who entered the project from the idea phase and most likely some will go ahead with the project and others will want to leave. If the tokens are released gradually, other opportunities will most likely appear (staking, providing liquidity, participating in DAO…) to be used and maybe they will be less tempted to sell and leave the project. So vesting is good!
