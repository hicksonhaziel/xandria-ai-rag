Solving the Blockchain Trilemma
The Challenge: The Storage Trilemma


Storing massive amounts of data on a blockchain is a huge challenge.
 

Xandeum is tackling a specific Storage Trilemma that holds back decentralized technology: smart contract native, scalable to exabytes, and random access. Most solutions can’t deliver all three, forcing trade-offs that limit blockchain’s potential.

​​

Here's what we need to solve the storage Trilemma.​
​

​

​

​​

​

Smart Contract Native: Storage must integrate
seamlessly with smart contracts to enable
dynamic, programmable applications directly
on the blockchain.

​

​

​

Scalable to Exabytes: Blockchain storage needs to handle massive datasets—think billions of gigabytes—without slowing down or becoming unaffordable.​

​

​

Random Access: Users and
apps need to quickly retrieve
specific data without sifting through entire datasets, making storage practical for real world use.

Xandeum’s Solution: A Revolutionary Storage Layer
 

Xandeum is building a groundbreaking storage layer that solves the Storage Trilemma by integrating directly with Solana, one of the fastest blockchains. Our innovative approach ensures storage is smart contract native, scalable to exabytes, and supports random access. Here’s how we make it happen:

​

Smart Contract Native: Adding the Hard Drive to Blockchain

Xandeum seamlessly integrates a scalable storage layer into Solana, enabling smart contracts to store and manage data directly on-chain. Developers can build dynamic apps—like decentralized marketplaces or social platforms—with ease, using storage as a native part of the blockchain.

Scalable to Exabytes+ : Xandeum pNodes

Our network of storage provider nodes (pNodes) stores data in pages with configurable redundancy levels, ensuring billions of gigabytes can be handled efficiently. This makes Xandeum ready for the massive data demands of the future, keeping costs low and performance high.

Random Access: Peek and Poke Primitives

Xandeum’s Peek (read) and Poke (write) operations allow developers to quickly retrieve or update specific data between Solana accounts and our storage layer. This makes data access fast, editable, and practical for real-world applications.

Built for Trust: Integration with Solana Validators

Even standard Solana validators help validate storage operations using cryptographic proofs, ensuring data integrity and security. This decentralized approach eliminates single points of failure, keeping your data safe and reliable.

Why Does This Matter?
 

A Giant Leap for Humanity:
Throughout history, key innovations—fire, the wheel, the printing press, the internet—have propelled humanity forward by increasing autonomy and reducing reliance on centralized authorities. Web3 is the next step in that journey, and Xandeum provides the missing link to make it a reality.

Join Us on This Exciting Journey:
We’re not just solving a technical problem; we’re igniting a revolution that will reshape the future of the internet. With Xandeum’s scalable storage layer, we’re unlocking the true potential of Web3—creating a decentralized, user-owned ecosystem where innovation can thrive.​
