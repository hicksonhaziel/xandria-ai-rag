At Xandeum, we’re committed to building trust and transparency in our community as we advance Solana’s scalable storage layer. This week, we’re addressing key updates: our official link shortener, the completion of Airdrop 1, and the value of holding XAND tokens for long-term participation in our ecosystem. 






Official Link Shortener: xnd.to 




We’ve heard concerns from our community about the legitimacy of our link 

shortener, “xnd.to.” We want to clarify that xnd.to is Xandeum’s official link 

shortener, designed to provide secure, concise access to our resources, such as stake.xandeum.network or Xandeum.network. Using xnd.to ensures you’re 

interacting with verified Xandeum links, protecting you from phishing attempts. Always verify links through our official channels, like Xandeum.network, to stay safe while engaging with our platform. This tool streamlines access to our 

ecosystem, making it easier to explore our storage layer and staking opportunities. 






Airdrop 1: Direct Wallet Distribution 




We’re thrilled to announce that Xandeum has completed Airdrop 1, distributing the remaining 10,281,163 XAND tokens (valued at approximately $95,000 at the time of 

distribution) directly to 5,240 eligible wallets. Unlike traditional airdrops requiring manual claims, we’ve streamlined the process by sending XAND directly to your wallet, ensuring seamless access to your rewards. This reflects our commitment 

to user-friendly experiences and sets the stage for Airdrop 2, details of which will be shared soon on points.xandeum.network. Stay engaged to maximize your rewards as we continue to grow. 






The Power of Holding XAND 




Holding XAND tokens is more than just owning a digital asset—it’s your gateway to shaping Xandeum’s future. By holding XAND long-term, you can stake in our innovative liquid staking pool at xandsol.xandeum.network, earning up to 16% APY while maintaining liquidity with xandSOL. Staking boosts your rewards and strengthens the network’s decentralized storage layer, which solves the 

blockchain storage trilemma with exabyte-scale, smart contract-native, and random-access capabilities. Additionally, locking XAND via constant lockup, for 30+ days on our Realms governance platform grants voting power in the Xandeum DAO, as well as a 16% APY on your XAND token. As a DAO member, you can propose and vote on critical decisions, like treasury allocation or storage layer enhancements, directly influencing projects like our decentralized Wikipedia. Long-term holders drive our community’s vision, ensuring a robust, censorship resistant, tamper-resistant, and most importantly, decentralized ecosystem. 

These updates mark exciting progress for Xandeum. Our xnd.to shortener simplifies access, Airdrop 1 rewards our community effortlessly, and holding XAND empowers you to stake, govern, and build with us.
