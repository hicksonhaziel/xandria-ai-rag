Introduction




The blockchain landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, with Solana

standing out as a high-performance & most viable platform capable of powering

the next generation of decentralized applications dubbed dApps. However, one

critical piece has been missing: scalable, efficient storage that integrates

seamlessly with Solana smart contracts on the blockchain. At Xandeum, we’re

addressing this gap by building a revolutionary scalable storage layer for Solana,

and at the heart of this innovation are our pNodes—short for provider nodes.

These nodes form the backbone of our decentralized storage network, offering a

unique opportunity for participants to contribute to and benefit from the future of

data-heavy Web3 applications.






What are pNodes?




pNodes, or provider nodes, are the decentralized storage units that power Xandeum’s scalable storage layer on Solana. Unlike traditional Solana accounts, which store data across every validator node (approximately 2,000 at present of writing), Xandeum offloads storage to a separate network of pNodes. This design introduces a random-access, file-system-like storage layer that’s easily accessible by smart contracts, offering a solution that scales to exabytes of capacity without overburdening the Solana blockchain.




The Xandeum storage layer leverages pNodes to store data in a distributed manner, using erasure coding and configurable redundancy levels to ensure security and availability. Data is then managed, and distributed across multiple pNodes, supervised cryptographically by validator nodes (vNodes) running Xandeum-enabled software. This hybrid approach maintains blockchain-grade integrity while freeing Solana validators from the burden of storing every piece of data. Developers interact with this storage layer through extended Solana primitives—such as "peek" and "poke"—enabling seamless data transfers between Solana accounts and Xandeum’s “Buckets,” our decentralized file system abstraction.




In essence, pNodes are the infrastructure that makes Xandeum’s vision possible:

adding the “hard drive” to Solana’s “world computer, ”complementing its computational power (CPU) and account-based memory (RAM). By providing scalable, smart contract-native storage, pNodes unlock new possibilities for data-intensive dApps on the Solana blockchain, like our soon-to-be-released decentralized wikipedia entirely on Web3.






Why Buy pNodes?




Investing in pNodes offers a compelling opportunity for those looking to get in

early on a transformative blockchain innovation. The value proposition of owning a

pNode lies in both immediate rewards and long-term potential within the Xandeum

ecosystem.




Early Access and Rewards

In our inaugural “Deep South” era (detailed at Xandeum.Network/innovation-eras),

we’re launching with a limited sale of just 300 pNodes, capped at 3 pNodes per

wallet. Priced at 35,000 XAND each—equivalent to under $100 at current rates—

these pNodes are able to be ran on a modest setup: we’ve found that you can run

a small VPS (e.g., $5.50 a month) and our pNode software with efficient results. During our incentivized devnet, pNode operators can be expected to earn approximately 10,000 XAND per month, locked for 12 months. However, the real incentive lies beyond the devnet: establishing a foothold in Xandeum’s storage network as it transitions to main net.




Proportional Rewards Model

Once the file-system-like storage layer is fully live, pNode rewards will be

calculated based on a algorithm that multiplies performance, storage capacity

provided, and stake (in XAND). Each pNode requires a stake in $XAND to operate,

and operators can set a commission rate, retaining a portion of the rewards while

distributing the rest to their stakers. This model mirrors the economics of validator

nodes on other major blockchain networks, where early adopters secure a lasting

advantage. As Xandeum grows and storage demand increases, early pNode

operators will be positioned to capture a significant share of the fees generated by

storage-enabled dApps (sedApps), paid in SOL.




Strategic Positioning in Web3

The blockchain space rewards early movers. Just as early validators on networks

like Ethereum and Solana amassed outsized influence and rewards, pNode

operators stand to benefit as Xandeum’s storage layer becomes integral to

Solana’s ecosystem. With only 300 pNodes available in the DeepSouth era,

securing one now offers a head start in Web3 smart contract storage—a sector

poised for explosive growth. As more developers build sedApps requiring scalable

storage, pNodes will become increasingly valuable, both as a revenue source and

as a stake in a decentralized network governed by the XAND DAO.




Low Entry Barrier, High Potential

The affordability of pNodes (under $100 plus minimal VPS costs) lowers the

barrier to entry compared to running a full Solana validator, yet the upside

potential is substantial. By staking XAND and providing storage, pNode operators

not only earn rewards but also contribute to a critical infrastructure layer,

positioning themselves at the forefront of Solana’s evolution.






Who are pNodes for?




pNodes are designed for a diverse group of participants, each with unique

motivations for joining the Xandeum network. Our scalable storage layer, set to go

live later this year, targets three key audiences: sedApp developers, existing

Solana validator operators, and blockchain enthusiasts looking to be on the

forefront of web3 evolution.




Developers Building sedApps

Our primary target in the “Deep South” stage is developers—“devs”—who will

drive the adoption of Xandeum’s storage layer by building storage-enabled dApps,

or sedApps. Once live, sedApps can leverage “XTransactions” (Xandeum

Transactions) to move data between Solana accounts and the Xandeum storage

layer using our dubbed “peek and poke” primitives. These transactions incur

additional fees in SOL, with a portion (likely 4%) allocated to the XAND DAO

($XAND token holders) and the remainder distributed to pNode operators

providing the storage service. For devs, pNodes represent the infrastructure that

makes their data-intensive applications possible, from large-scale databases to

real-time analytics platforms. By owning pNodes, developers can directly support

and profit from their own sedApps.




Solana Validator Operators

pNodes also appeal to those already running Solana validators. These operators

are familiar with the technical and economic dynamics of blockchain networks and

can easily extend their expertise to Xandeum’s storage layer. By integrating

pNodes into their operations, validators can diversify their potential revenue

streams, earning SOL rewards from storage fees alongside traditional staking

rewards. Since pNodes are supervised by Xandeum-aware validator nodes

(vNodes), existing validators can play a dual role, enhancing their influence within

both Solana and Xandeum.




Blockchain Enthusiasts and Early Adopters

Finally, pNodes are for blockchain enthusiasts eager to get in on the ground floor

of a promising project. Whether you’re a Web3 advocate, a Solana supporter, or

simply someone looking for the next big opportunity, running a pNode offers a

chance to participate in a pioneering effort. The low cost of entry, combined with

the potential for significant rewards as the network scales, makes pNodes an

attractive proposition for those who see the future of decentralized storage

unfolding on Solana.






Conclusion




pNodes are more than just storage providers—they’re the foundation of

Xandeum’s mission to complete Solana’s vision as a decentralized world computer.

By offering scalable, random-access storage that integrates natively with smart

contracts, pNodes enable a new wave of innovative dApps while rewarding

operators with both short-term and long-term benefits. Whether you’re a

developer building the next killer sedApp, a Solana validator diversifying your

portfolio, or an enthusiast passionate about web3’s future, pNodes offer a unique

opportunity to shape and profit from the evolution of blockchain technology. With

only 300 available in the “Deep South” era, the time to act is now—because in the

world of blockchain, being early is everything. Join us on March 25, 2025, as we

launch our incentivized devnet pNodes and take the first step toward a scalable,

decentralized future on Solana.
