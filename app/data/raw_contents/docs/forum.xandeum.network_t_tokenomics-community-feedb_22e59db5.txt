I’ve just had a quick read through the tokenomics and first impressions are good. Lots of questions are springing to mind which I’m sure will get answered in Bernie’s videos or by discussions on the Forum here or on Discord. My main question at the moment is "Can I use my XAND for the liquid staking or will I need to invest SOL? And if I need to invest SOL, can I swop some XAND for SOL on a Solana DEX such as Jupiter? And roughly how many XAND will equal one SOL?
