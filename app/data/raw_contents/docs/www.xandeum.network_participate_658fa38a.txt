Secure the Network, Earn Rewards

Running a vNode on Xandeum's devnet will put you in a pole position to later run a vNode on mainnet as well as become an RPC provider for Xandeum. You will be able to receive rewards from the XFRP as well as XFDP (Xandeum foundation rewards program and Xandeum foundation delegation program). For later rewards in mainnet, it is essential that you have been running a performant vNode on devnet.
