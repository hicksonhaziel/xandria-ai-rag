Overview

Xandeum's Setup Guide is a streamlined resource for launching your participation in Solana's scalable storage revolution. Whether you're deploying a pNode to contribute storage capacity or a vNode to validate network integrity, this guide equips you with step-by-step instructions.

Below, explore summaries of the pNode and vNode guides, with links to details for hands-on implementation.

pNode Setup

pNodes form the backbone of Xandeum's scalable storage, enabling data sharding via erasure coding and gossip protocols. The guide covers hardware requirements (e.g., minimum CPU/RAM/disk specs for DevNet), software installation (Ubuntu preferred), installation, and key steps: generating key pairs with XandMiner, registering via the daemon (XandMinerD). 

It highlights security best practices (non-standard ports, SSH keys) and troubleshooting for common issues like connectivity failures. 

For full instructions, see the Xandeum pNode Setup Guide
﻿
 section.

vNode Setup

vNodes ensure network trust by monitoring pNode integrity through cryptographic proofs, offloading validation from Solana's core chain. This section outlines prerequisites (e.g., Solana CLI tools, sufficient SOL for staking), software installation of validator software, configuration for DevNet syncing, and activation via the Foundation Delegation Program. 

It includes tips for optimizing uptime, integrating with Pod Monitor analytics, and handling epoch-based rewards. Aligned with the Green Paper's vision for tamper-proof resilience, vNodes support the storage trilemma resolution by enabling seamless data reconstruction. Dive into the complete walkthrough in the Validator Home

 section.

Conclusion

Xandeum's setup guide bridges theory to action, empowering you to join a community-operated ecosystem that's evolving rapidly through eras like South (foundational pNodes) and North (intelligent prototypes). Once configured, monitor performance via the web GUI and contribute to mainnet milestones. Start today to unlock rewards and shape Solana's scalable storage future. For deeper context, reference the Innovation Eras overview or Green Paper for technical foundations.
