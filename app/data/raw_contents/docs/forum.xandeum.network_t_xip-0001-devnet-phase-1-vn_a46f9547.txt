XIP: Incentivized Devnet, Part 1: vNodes

Type: Non-Executable (Multiple-Choice)

Choices:

Yes (approve the incentivized devnet vNode plan)
No (reject this proposal)
Proposal Description
Summary

We propose to launch an incentivized devnet to support Xandeum’s development and community-building efforts. This devnet will serve as a testing ground for intermediate releases and provide valuable feedback before mainnet. In this first phase, we focus on incentivizing vNode (validator node) operators, ensuring they contribute to a stable, high-performing devnet. Subsequent phases will address pNodes (storage nodes) and RPC nodes (Dock and CachedAccess providers).

Context

Xandeum aims to build a scalable, blockchain-grade storage layer for Solana and potentially Ethereum EVM-based smart contract platforms, integrated with a side network of Pods, Atlas indexing, and Dock logic. As we iterate on our technology, we need a stable reference network—the devnet—to validate our assumptions, test intermediate code changes, and foster a community of skilled operators who understand the platform’s vision.

Goals
Establish a devnet from December 30, 2024, until June 30, 2025, running modified Agave clients as vNodes.
Provide performance-based incentives to encourage stable, efficient validation.
Begin building a dedicated community of node operators who will play key roles as we transition toward testnet and mainnet.
Lay the foundation for integrating pNodes and RPC nodes in subsequent proposals.
Details of the vNode Incentivization
1. Devnet Timeline
Start: December 30, 2024
End: June 30, 2025
2. Staking and Performance Requirement
Each vNode operator will receive a 10,000 SOL (Xandeum devnet SOL) stake account from the Xandeum Foundation.
The validator must maintain performance. Performance is measured by the monthly average staking rewards relative to the top 3 best-earning validators.
Threshold: At least 85% of the top-3 average staking rewards.
Incentives:
Meeting the threshold earns the full monthly incentive.
Falling below reduces incentives proportionally. Example: Achieving 42.5% of the top-3 average results in 50% of the monthly incentives.
3. Incentives
Base Incentive: 10,000 XAND per month (locked for 12 months in the DAO before they can be claimed).
Incentives will be paid out of the Community Building category of the DAO treasury.
Participants active by January 15, 2025, will receive full compensation for January, regardless of performance.
4. Hardware Recommendations for vNodes
Minimum: 8 vCPUs/threads, 32GB RAM, 500GB SSD storage, and 10 Mbit/s upload/download bandwidth.
These are recommendations only—performance is the ultimate criterion.
VPS (Virtual Private Servers) are allowed and expected to meet cluster performance requirements. Participants may choose their provider and specifications.
5. Participant Requirements
Capacity: Aiming for at least 35, but no more than 40 devnet vNodes. Onboarding will close once 40 nodes are online.
KYC: Participants must complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, including:
Name, address, date of birth.
$1 credit card transaction (Antsle, Inc. will process on behalf of Xandeum Foundation).
ID verification via an external provider chosen by Antsle, Inc.
Restrictions:
Maximum of 1 incentivized devnet vNode per participant.
Participants bear all expenses for hardware, hosting, connectivity, operations, etc.
Rationale
Linking incentives to performance ensures a healthy devnet and provides realistic feedback on validator behavior.
Locking incentives for 12 months aligns operators with the project’s long-term vision.
Conclusion

Approving this proposal sets the stage for a robust devnet, staffed by engaged and competent validators. This incentivized environment will accelerate development, improve code quality, and foster a loyal community, ultimately benefiting Xandeum’s journey toward a storage-enabled, blockchain-grade solution.

Community discussion of this XIP is happening at the Xandeum Forum.
