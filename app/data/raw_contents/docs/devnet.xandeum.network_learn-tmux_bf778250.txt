Tmux is a teminal multiplexor...allowing you to run more than one terminal instance in the same window and switch between them. 

It also allows you multiple pages that can have one or more panes of terminal windows.

Added benifits are that the windows all stay running and multiple people can view and work on the same session at the same time.

This isn't required, but is a helpful tool once you learn how to use it.
