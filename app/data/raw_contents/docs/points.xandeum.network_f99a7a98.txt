Why We Track Engagement

Our platform thrives on active participation, and we believe in acknowledging every contribution. The Engagement Tracker is our way of quantifying your involvement through a points system. Whether you're spreading the word, engaging with our content, or participating in our ecosystem, we want to ensure your efforts are recognized and rewarded. Transparency is key: we request user data to accurately track and reward your actions. This data enables us to verify tasks you complete, ensuring a fair and rewarding system for all. Your privacy and trust are paramount, guiding our data handling practices.

How It Works: Simple, Rewarding, and Transparent

Connecting Your Wallet:

Earning Points:

Rewards and Progress:

Your points accumulate, showing your effort and conviction. Progress is transparent, with a leaderboard to spark healthy competition and community spirit.

Data Usage:

The data we collect serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it verifies your completed tasks, ensuring an honest and efficient points allocation. Secondly, it enhances your user experience.

Privacy:

We respect your privacy. Data collection is minimal, purpose-driven, and always with your consent. We're committed to maintaining a secure environment where your information is protected.
