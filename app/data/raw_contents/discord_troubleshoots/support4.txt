Sometimes the first tweet that you try makes you go through the login process and then seems to "flake out" and do nothing, however when I go check it has gone through even though it didn't show it.  Sometimes, not all the time.  🙂

Can't unstake xandsol with ledger.
Tried in Phantom and Solflare.
Just says to ensure blind signing is enable etc (Which it is)
Help please.

Also does it cost to 'instant unstake'?
I tried and it says 'transaction reverted, your funds may be lost if you proceed'

Hi, I want to swop a small portion of my XandSol to Sol but getting 'no routes found' on both Jupiter and Raydium. Any suggestions?
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 1/19/25, 1:01 PM
Seems OK for me (Jupiter swap settings "auto", for amounts ~ 1000 SOL, not for 10000 SOL), but if you staked SOL to XandSOL, perhaps unstake is better route?
mikev — 1/19/25, 9:15 PM
When I try to unstake the XandSol it's asking me to connect my Ledger as the wallet connected is my Phantom Ledger account. I've connected my Ledger, selected Solana account and my Ledger device is now saying 'Application is Ready'. But I'm still getting the 'Please connect your Ledger device' message so can't complete the transaction. Any suggestions gratefully received thank you!

Don't worry about that, Phantom just sometimes does not know the price, but in other places (Solflare, Jupiter...) it's displayed correctly. Sometimes we even do small manual xandSOL <-> SOL swap to make it (Phantom) update the price. :-)

Hi. I'm running a pNode setup on Debian 12, but the GUI webpage says it can't find a drive, while I have a partition setup for this. Does xandminer detect partitions, as said in the guide, or only whole drives? And do they need to be formatted in ext3, 4 or btrfs and mounted?
NeoBubba

Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/17/25, 8:08 PM
Hi, I am not from team, but based on index.tsx and helpers.js source files, the code seems to parse all disks in system... so I guess it should see them, no matter the filesystem. (but mounted of course)
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/17/25, 9:47 PM
Welp, I just mounted the partition to /media/pNodeStorage. Does this mean I also have to add that partition to fstab?
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/17/25, 9:59 PM
Yes, if you want it mounted automatically after reboot. So, does Xandminer see the extra space? I hope so. (perhaps try systemctl restart xandminer, xandminerd if not...) 
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/17/25, 10:52 PM
Maybe it has something to do with some trouble I saw when installing Xandminer withthe package liblzma5. Version  5.4.1-0.2 is installed, but would be upgraded to 5.6.3-1+b1, and then I get the error message that I'm holding broken packages. Maybe this has to do not being on Ubuntu, and/or going from Debian 12 Testing to the stable Bookworm release with only changing the apt source files. 
While I do not have much experience with building apps, but it seems to build fine, further on. 
But still no storage drives found. Even when I plugged in a high-speed USB3.1 drive. 
Restarted xandminer and xandminerd with systemctl offcourse.
I just wonder if it is the above or that I missed a step in installing Xandminer. The guide seems pretty well documented, and rather easy to do. So prob my sys is quirky.
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/17/25, 10:59 PM
I don't think liblzma causes this (broken packages can be fixed, but first things first), if the build finishes and services are running (systemctl status), but if you can't see any drive at all - make sure you open ssh ports 3000 and 4000 tunnel, as described in documentation. Sorry if repating what you know. :-)
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/17/25, 11:05 PM
Yeah, I use the command ssh -i %userprofile%\.ssh\id_ed25519 <user>@<ip> -L 4000:localhost:4000 -L 3000:localhost:3000 from a Windows pc, where my browser with Phantom Wallet is on, to be able to connect that wallet to it, but detecting the storage is something internal on that machine intself, right?
When I open that tunnel with ssh, the localhost:3000-page loads immediately, stating that "No Drives Found" under the "Drive Information" headline. I can connect the Phantom wallet and generate a pNode Identity Pubkey.
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/17/25, 11:10 PM
Yes, but without the tunnel, page loads with "Daemon offline" and zero storage available. So, on the Debian, systemctl status xandminer* shows them both running without restarts?
Update: OK, so you are using the tunnel, hmm. Top right corner, daemon online? 
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/17/25, 11:14 PM
Yes, the daemon says it is online. 
I tested if I only tunnel the 3000 port, I get the situation you mentioned. Daemon offline and zero storage.
So it seems that both 3000 and 4000 are not blocked at the node server.
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/17/25, 11:17 PM
OK, so going back to that library, Grok recommends:
sudo apt-mark unhold liblzma5
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install liblzma5=5.6.3-1+b1
sudo apt --fix-broken install
Edit /etc/apt/sources.list, remove testing/extra repos, then:
sudo apt update
install xandminer.
That's probably all I can think about now...

It seems to need liblzma5 version  5.4.1-0.2, but 5.6.3-1+b1 is installed. (I got it reversed stated somehow.) Can this newer package be removed so that the older version that seems to be needed can be installed?
Or else I'm afraid I need to clean install Debian 12.
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/17/25, 11:26 PM
I guess you can apt remove liblzma, then apt install liblzma5=5.4.1.-0.2?

Translated to English:
"Some packages could not be installed. This may mean
that you asked for an impossible situation, or, if you
using the distribution 'unstable', that some required packages have yet to be created or were removed from 'Incoming'."
So it seems I have to install Debian anew, I guess.
And "Unfulfilled Requirements:
 apt : Requirements: libapt-pkg7.0 (>= 2.9.30) but it will not be installed
 dpkg : Pre-requisites: liblzma5 (>= 5.4.0) but it will not install
 python3 : Prerequisites: python3.12 (>= 3.12.7-1~) but it will not be installed
           Prerequisites: libpython3-stdlib (= 3.12.8-1) but it will not be installed
Error: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve yielded defects. This may be caused by stuck packages."

Well, I guess I'll be backing up and reinstalling tomorrow.

Ga. Did install Debian 12 Bookworm and the build went well, without liblzma5 error's, but it still can't find the partition or any free space for storage.
@Substance 2.42 Could you check what file system you have on the pNode storage disks/partitions?
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/18/25, 3:10 PM
ext4
Daemon online? You don't have another forgotten ssh 3000/4000 tunnel opened somewhere, stealing your connection, right? Both systemctl status xandminer* running? 
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/18/25, 3:12 PM
I don't think so as I am getting the same results as when I access it with the local browser. I am using btrfs at the moment. Could try ext4 by formatting it via Gparted.
Also, are all your partitions ext4 and do you have multiple disks, or just 1 with a few partitions on it? 
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/18/25, 3:16 PM
Just one disk with ext4 mounted at /, plus few usual tmpfs and EFI partitions, but they're not relevant here.
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/18/25, 3:36 PM
And it sees the / mounted free space for use as pNode storage at the GUI?
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/18/25, 3:36 PM
Yes.
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/18/25, 3:50 PM
Cool! But I just changed my partition to ext4 and mounted it via fstab, restarted both services, and it still does not see any space or disks.
So I am beginning to wonder if it has to do that the installed system runs on btrfs and not on ext4. But should that even matter? 
Looking at the requirement specs: I got 16 GB of RAM. Should it matter the PC is is a 2 core 4 threads model instead of 4 cores? 
Or does xandminer test internet speeds, or hard drive speeds? It has a SATA SSD... 
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/18/25, 3:58 PM

Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/18/25, 4:17 PM
No I don't think Xandminer tests anything yet, so far it is just kinda empty envelope, the engine will come later. You sure installation went through OK? For example I had to install chromium for some reason and run install again.

Just tried with a bigger ext4 formated root / partition and the old /home data copied to the ext4 formatted drive. Then it occured to me that maybe / is to small, so I set a swap partition of 16 GB, a 91 GB / and made the 102 GB partition my new /home. I installed Debian 12 Bookworm with KDE Plasma (my favorite DE). Didn't need to install Chromium. Still no drives are being found in the remote webGUI after running the services. 
Even checked if ports 3000 and 4000 were in use on the network somewhere. 
I wonder: are there any ports that need to be opened in the ISP router for it to get accessed from the internet (WAN) side? Or is that step only necessary if the disks are found and shared?
At the moment, it feels my marbles are rolling all over the place. 🤪
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/18/25, 7:07 PM
Sorry if I repeat myself :-), but - does top right corner of web say "Daemon online"? SSH tunnel via root is active I guess. Both services are running. No firewall blocking 3000 and 4000 ports. At the moment, I think disk space is not allocated or used yet, and it's enough to get registered.
Also, if you have "telnet" on remote machine, you can try "telnet (your miner IP) 3000" and same for 4000 - we don't want to actually telnet, just to see if something will respond...

Yeah, my touchpad wasn't working in X, but it does on Wayland, and I have to remember how to install the Wi-Fi firmware driver again. But I digress. I thought newer kernels would only support more, instead of ditching old and adding newer hardware support. To bad, I couldn't let it run - just to test it - on a Steam Deck (which runs Arch).
My last attempt was pure root, instead of my previous attempt: running in a user account with sudo privileges. But it didn't seem to matter much.

I talked with Grok again (note: I am able to my own ideas, but not always haha), and there is one more idea:
"Ubuntu 22.04 LTS “Jammy Jellyfish”
Why: Long-term support (till 2027), polished EFI handling, broader hardware support than Debian.
Fit: Kernel 5.15—tuned for Intel 7 Series SATA, Mac EFI quirks."
Maybe worth a try?

Does the client only work on NVME drives and does not detect SATA SSDs, because of the throughput speed?

Resized my root partition to maximum possible and installed Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS, but still no disks found. 
Macbook Pro 9,2 (Mid 2011?) with 16 GB RAM and 250 GB SATA SSD. Tried btrfs and ext4, but I do not believe it's important. 
Waiting for a backup of a 512 GB SSD in my PS4, so I can check if it is a size requirement that wasn't met with the 240 GB drive. 
And if that does not work, I might setup something on a Unraid server. Ubuntu VM on the SSD cache pool probably.

Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/24/25, 2:13 AM
So it seems a /home partition doesn't take, and the other partitions are available if the kernel is 6.1 (in Debian Bookworm), while 6.8 (in Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS) does not see any drives. 🤷
So now only I need to get the tunnel set right to the VM running on Unraid, connect the wallet and claim the node.
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 3/24/25, 2:57 AM
Or the true 4 core (which are 2 cores 4 threads appointed to the VM on Unraid) vs 2 cores, 4 threads detection? I'm a bit clueless.
So in the end I managed to run a previous installed Debian Bookworm VM on my Unraid system, addressed some more harddrive space to the VM and added that to a new partition of about 80 GB and exposed its IP to the LAN via network bridging and go the tunnel working. Now I only need to claim a pNode sometime tomorrow... 😁

It reads under "Blockdevices", "type: disk", with its "mountpoints: null" and below that its children that read "type: part" and "mountpoints: /boot/efi" and a second one that states "swap" and the biggest one states "/" in the json readout on the Ubuntu system and on the Unraid system it mentions the about the same things, only using "vdaX" instead of "sdaX" for the disks and partitions.
Both systems mention "Linux" btw.

If you don't know that song you're probably not running a server in devnet.... 🤣

So I got Debian Bookworm with kernel 6.1.0-32-amd64 installed on the same MacBook Pro I previously mentioned, and it detects the rest of the root partition for use for the pNode. So to have the disks and partitions detected, this kernel version is required. ✅
Thanks @Substance 2.42 for your help!

Hi guys, I'm trying to install a pnode on my local Proxmox server Version 8.3.5. I have install a Ubuntu LXC container Version 22.04. I run the install.sh OK, but get lots of warnings about deprecated packages & unnecessary dependency, but I do get the "Setup completed successfully!". I can run "curl http://localhost:3000/" locally on the LXC successfully. But if is blocked if I run curl http://192.168.x.x:3000/ from another VM or my local network. The connection is refused... The Firewall status on the VE host is disabled/running. The Firewall on the LXC is not running, LXC ufw status is inactive. something is blocking the ports 3000 & 4000, but I can figure out what....Can anyone help?

You can ask specific p-node install questions on this channel but I would recommend you do a bit of homework first. Cheers.
