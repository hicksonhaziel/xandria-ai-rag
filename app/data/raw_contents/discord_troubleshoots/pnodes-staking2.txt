Hi everyone, we have heard the frustration of some of you who are having issues setting up your PNodes.
We chatted with Bernie and have come up with an idea, from Xandeum supporters for Xandeum supporters.
Introducing ChillXand. We are the “set it and forget it” solution for managing pNodes. Our name says it all: you chill out, we handle the stress.

We position ourselves as the trusted partner that removes technical headaches, maximizes uptime, and ensures pNode owners earn without worry.

Much needed service for sure...this will provide peace of mind that pNodes are always "active" and "running", minimising any downtime. Thanks @Chill Marketing guy  for the community initiative and sharing this with our Xandeum community 🔥 💪  as the more active participation, the better for Xandeum as an entire project. As Bernie says: the pNode holders, we "are" Xandeum.  So we need to all be working together, decentralised and getting the word out.  No limitations to low/non-techies or time poor investors, if the tech hurdles are well taken care of by ChillXand team 🎯

Hey! The controller is a dashboard that gives you a quick heads up status check of your PNodes when they’re being managed by ChillXand.
We’re really excited to be offering assistance, given we’ve heard a lot of people voicing concern about the technical nature of setting up and running these Nodes.
We want this initiative to succeed and we’re happy to help if we can.

Role icon, Chat Mod — 9/10/25, 8:59 PM
Okay, but registering is something else then onboarding. Registering is nothing more then connecting the generated wallet address of your pNodes to the manager wallet and that is shown on the seenodes-pages. In order to get rewards in the form of XAND every month from the Xandeum Foundation, the onboarding is necessary at Xandeum.
rn 262 are registered. My new one still is not bc Netcup trips over my identification info... quite frustrating. 
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 9/10/25, 9:22 PM
Onboarding is 100% needed, there must be some KYC to get rewards. I have fresh pNodes that are not even registered, waiting for mainnet, and they show up on the seenodes atlas page just fine, why wouldn't they.
And yes, the numbers 0.3.1/0.3.1/0.4.0 are perfect. 
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 9/10/25, 9:24 PM
So technically, they are "registered", but not "onboarded"?
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 9/10/25, 9:28 PM
What? :-) My "waiting" pNodes are NOT registered (I don't need new pkeys), and of course also not onboarded. I just wanted to set them up already because it's fun. :-) You know, need twice as much pNodes as public keys for testnet/mainnet.
Bottom line: I believe onboarding of new devnet pNodes is needed (when available). But rewards are for whole month anyway, so no rush, 20 days left. :-)
Hey Grok, can you rephrase my response because I am unable to write like sane person? 
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 9/10/25, 9:56 PM
Oh, I wrote "I have fresh pNodes that are not even registered, waiting for mainnet, and they show up on the seenodes page just fine" - no, I mean they show up in "atlas", not seenodes - sorry!

Is it possible to switch a pnode from devnet to mainnet at a later stage?

Why would you do that?  The you'd get no foundation stake.
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 9/10/25, 10:08 PM
I definitely hope so! :-) But no information about that yet.
And why I want that - because of one nice devnet pNode running here at home, and one devnet VPS that is too good for testnet. Are the IPs used in onboarding important? We don't know.

Are you trying to dedicate more space? There is none left. And some is needed for the OS to run and logs to fill with data. 
If you want to remove the dedicated space, you need to remove the /xandeum-pages file with rm /xandeum-pages and re-dedicate space to it over the localhost page.

 — 9/18/25, 9:53 PM
I want to be transparent that I don't currently own any of the Dutch Auction pNodes, though I would love to if they were within my budget. I have some concerns about selling NFT boosts separately, as I worry this might undervalue the original investment that Dutch Auction participants made.
It seems somewhat comparable to offering North pNode holders the ability to upgrade to Deep South functionality later - while potentially beneficial for some, it could diminish the value proposition that early supporters paid a premium for.
It's also worth noting that those Deep South pNode holders have been running their nodes for many, many months, actively contributing to the team's development and testing efforts. Their ongoing commitment and contribution to the network's growth adds another layer to the value they've provided beyond just their initial investment.
I'd be interested in hearing how the team plans to balance expanding access with preserving the value of these early investments and contributions. 
foxdiddy — 9/19/25, 1:41 PM
I agree with mrhcon. Not only have the operators of the Deep South nodes been the bedrock of Xandeum (we’ve footed the investment to rollout 250 PNodes) and we’ve done that based on our faith in the project and promises made by Xandeum about the incentives being an early operator would provide. Now, you are moving the goal posts. Even worse, you are now almost 3 months in arrears on making your PNode disbursements (so, you’re literally begging for cash, while neglecting to pay your bills). This is a terrible look.
TSBP — 9/19/25, 3:30 PM
Here is what I commented after video #402....Mixed opinion about the NFTs.  Ideally, the team never should have offered those in the Dutch Auction.  The original 16x Deep South Era boost and requirement to be on DEVNET to get Foundation staking should have been enough incentive to sell the 49 pNodes to serious people in the community.  The team shouldn't keep coming out with better deals later at the expense of those that take the early risks and do what the team asks up front when they need our support.  I think it would be a nice gesture for the team to gift something to those original 300 old guard Pnodes (provided they get onboarded).  Maybe a compromise would be for the team to gift the lowest boost NFT auctioned off (Rabbit?) to all the original 300 pNodes that get onboarded so they get some extra earnings too for their early commitment, and also offer them an opportunity to purchase a higher boost NFT if they want...costs not to exceed those at auction (USDC price alone as they already paid Xand for their pNode).  Just an idea.
On another note, it woud be great if the team can work the pNode rewards claim into a simple claimable link on the participation page (https://www.xandeum.network/participate) without requiring the complicated DAO proposal activity.  Why is the DAO involved?  No vote is necessary on these.  They are promised rewards just like airdrops.  Just add a new 4th claim button on the participation page at #7 (Run a Xandeum pNode)....1-Why, 2-Setup, 3-Onboard, 4-CLAIM.  Too easy!

I see an upgrade to Ubuntu 24 LTS suggestion as well in the screenshots. Are running 22 LTS? Because pod needs the libraries from 24.
May I suggest that either you take the release upgrade route 
OR
make a backup of the keypair file and re-image the VPS with Ubuntu 24 LTS at Contabo's modern control panel and restore the private keys after installation. 
The latter has my recommendation.

Makes it kind or hard to run a complete a proper DevNet in order to produce a working network, when the pNodes required/requested are dormant though.

Xandeum has even given a second chance with the Dutch Auction to allow folks to get involved in order to get up to the 300 pNodes wanted for DevNet, and still there are dormant ones.

Does everyone know that without your DevNet pNode up and running properly, your STOINC will suffer?

Bernie mentioned there are metrics involved, so being unprepared when the time comes isn't going to go very well IMHO.  And then there is the 'pNode performance factor' which will be non-existent if you haven't got your DevNet pNodes running already, and proven on the DevNet.

Folks, if you have a pNode license, the time has come to ensure that you get everything squared away and start earning DevNet rewards BEFORE the time crunch comes.

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm working on building an analytics dashboard for pNodes and ran into an issue getting pod to start. 
When I try to run pod --rpc-ip 127.0.0.1 --keypair ~/.xandeum/keypairs/pnode-keypair.json, everything seems fine at first - the keypair validates successfully and it connects to the network, but then it crashes with:

Error: Symlinked File not Found : /run/xandeum-pod

I've tried creating the file manually (both as a file and directory) but that didn't work. Also tried running with sudo, same issue. The keypair itself is working fine, so I think it's something with the storage file setup.
Anyone know what I'm missing here? Is there a specific way I need to set up /run/xandeum-pod or maybe a different path I should be using? 

Running pod 0.6.0 on Ubuntu, installed via the apt repo. Any help would be appreciated!
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 12/7/25, 2:48 PM
When you dedicate space in GUI (where you created keypair), it will create /etc/tmpfiles.d/xandeum-pod.conf, and that will create /run/xandeum-pod link that points to created Xandeum "pagefile". So ls -l /run/xandeum-pod must show existing file.

Hi team, I am trying to programmatically access pNode information from Python.

I know that XandMiner UI talks to the local pNode daemon to get:

node status
segment data
bucket/FS info
storage metrics
heartbeat / uptime

But there is no public documentation showing the daemon’s REST API.

Could you please share:

The official local daemon API endpoints
The correct port it runs on
Whether a public/remote registry API exists for querying all pNodes
Any JSON schema or examples for interacting with the pNode backend

I want to build a Python client for monitoring pNodes.
Any help or pointers to internal docs would be great!

Hi, does anyone know the formula of ROI for running more than 3 pnodes?

In the example given on the Xandeum website there is only up to 3 pnodes in the formula, and I have not been able to find any information about the numbers in running more than 3.
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 12/13/25, 4:07 PM
What ROI formula? Do you mean the boostedCredits' one? -

As far as I can tell it something like this: 

Example
For a wallet with 3 pNodes and 100,000 storageCredits:
pNode 1: Boost factor = 1.5 (50% boost)
pNode 2: Boost factor = 1 (no boost)
pNode 3: Boost factor = 2 (100% boost)

boostedCredits = 100,000 × (1.5 × 1 × 2)^(1/3) ≈ 100,000 × 1.44225 = 144,225

+ pNode 4: Boost factor = 1 (no boost)
Would give: boostedCredits = 100,000 × (1.5 × 1 × 2 × 1)^(1/4) ≈ 100,000 × 1.31607 = 131,607

if 
+ pNode 4: Boost factor = 1.5 (50% boost)
Would give: boostedCredits = 100,000 × (1.5 × 1 × 2 × 1.5)^(1/4) ≈ 100,000 × 1.45648= 145,648

etcetera.
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 12/13/25, 4:12 PM
I asked PCHED AI:
What is the formula of storagecredits for running more than 3 pnodes?
Response:
boostedCredits = (pNode1.boostFactor * pNode2.boostFactor * pNode3.boostFactor * ... * pNodeN.boostFactor)^(1/N)
Where N is the number of pNodes you own.
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 12/13/25, 4:13 PM
Then STOINC will be total fees: 

All storage fees (in SOL) collected from sedApps in the epoch × pNode share: The share of fees for pNodes (e.g., 0.94 for 94%) × your boostedCredits calculated above
divided by
total boostedCredits: The sum of boostedCredits across all pNode-owning wallets.

So example 1000 SOL × 0.94 × 145,648 
divided by example 36.412.000 boostedCredits of all wallets will result in 3,76 SOL per epoch.

I can't confirm it's correct, especially since we just don't have some of the input data required to make any competent answer.

Thanks for answering. 
But in your answer there are two options for the 4th pnode - either it gives a boost or doesn’t, if I understand your message correct?

And I am curious to know if more than 3 pnodes adds more boost or if 3 pnodes give the max boost.

Thank you for this link to the generator. But it seems like the generator lacks the measures of total amount of pnodes and total amount of storage.

Not options per se, but examples. I highlighted in bold numbers what can be changed in order to get a correct calculation. One is for boostfactor and one for the amount of nodes.

What I don't understand is that the boost factor is determined by the Era it was bought in and what NFTs are bound to that node. Deep South gives a 16x (1500%) boost and a Titan NFT gives a 11x (1000%) boost. So 16 x 11 => 176x! BUT the examples calculations only shows NFT boosts...

Well, I use translation apps to check if my message comes through the way I want it. Double checking stuff. Takes a bit more effort and time. Darn that perfectionism!

Just FYI, tried your query again with the latest PCHED AI.

Looking forward to get more information about "bonding".

I added latest video Ep 417 to my simple AI and asked "What is pNode bonding?" - answer was not completely bad... sorry for spam. :-) As always with AI, asking "good" questions gives better results, and also some things just nobody knows yet.

Let's see if the total amount required for bond is into the millions or tens of millions. Although i doubt it would be in xandeum's interest to make it that high.
