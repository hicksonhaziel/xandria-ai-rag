pNode UPDATE version - pNode Setup Guide
Update your elready set up Xandeum pNode using this update guide.

@DevNet 
There was an update pushed to the install.sh script. The update will help handling reboots and instances where pod.service is failed and will not start.

All pNode operators should run the new install.sh  Option 3 - Restart to enable a config file at reboot to create a file association that pod.service is currently relying on. 

Use the link above in pNode UPDATE version to grab the newest install file.

@DevNet Attention vNode operators 
We would like to call for upgrade to Herrenberg version
https://github.com/Xandeum/xandeum-agave/tree/x2.2.0-herrenberg

We are discontinuing the pre-built binaries with this release. Please build from source.

I have published a tool that you may use if you wish. The system tuning script is intended to setup a new server or migrate an existing one from the directory structure of the vNode install guide to a more straight-forward one. Read the read me files and ask questions in ⁠devnet-validator-operations.

Some of the mods have used the tool and it has seemed effective.

@DevNet We're working on getting caught up on DevNet operator payments. 
We had planned to have an automated process ready to take care of this but it isn't ready.
We'll work at getting it up to date using the old method in the DAO this week.

pNode Onboarding Open!

Hello @DevNet operators,
You can now onboard your pNodes that you bought in the Dutch Auction. Go to https://pnode-onboarding.paperform.co/ and fill out the simple form. Make sure that everything is correct as we can legally not reonboard them for you anymore.

If you have trouble, check your connection, try another browser, or open a ticket on https://help.xandeum.network/.

Just a quick reminder @everyone that onboarding is still open and if you have registered pNodes that are not onboarded yet, now is the time! 😇  We can't pay you rewards without being onboarded unfortunately.
Brad|Xandeum-imposter DM'ing YouRole icon, XandeumTeam — 10/23/25, 8:22 PM
@DevNet :alert: :alert: :alert:  Attention pNode and vNode operators!! :alert: :alert: :alert: 

Make sure you are backing up your operator keypairs to a safe location. 
This key will be required to recover your pNode to a new server should you ever require to rebuild from scratch.
Currently only one pNode-keypair can be onboarded per pNode license purchased and there is no provision to use a new key to onboard again!
We are looking into a way to make this option available but have no timeline on an implementation.
Don't wipe or decommission a server without first backing up your pNode keypair.

For pNode operators, the key that is created during registration is located at:
/root/xandminerd/keypairs/pnode-keypair.json

You need to use a text editor (nano, vim, etc) to read this PRIVATE KEY and copy it to a safe location on a secure machine.

--

For vNode operators, the keys were created in your home directory if you followed the guide:

/home/sol/validator-keypair.json
/home/sol/vote-keypair.json
/home/sol/withdraw-keypair.json


Again, a text editor can be used to view the files and copy the contents to a secure machine.
Also, the withdraw keypair is required to withdraw funds from the vote account so the keys should not be stored together if there is economic value secured by the keys. (mainnet)

--

Be mindful that these are private keys, and if you lose them, there is no way to gain access to the contents or sign anything that was associated with them.
Also, if someone else gains access to these keys, they will have control of anything in or associated with those keys as well, so treat them securely!

v0.5 "Ingolstadt" is out. 🚢

pNode operators update your pod.
Blockchain Bernie | Xandeum LabsRole icon, XandeumTeam — 11/29/25, 8:13 PM
@everyone We found and fixed some issues that some of you encountererd upgrading to the latest Ingolstadt release. It should work for most now. If [Update pNode] in the Xandminer GUI won't work, try running ./install.sh via ssh and select option 2, update Xandeum pNode software.

@DevNet 
We have released tracking information for pNode Credits. 
It's tracking responses and failed attempts to contact, as well as responses (or failures) to data (peek/poke etc...) events and its creating a sort of reputation that resets monthly! 
Take a look, find a way to track yours (or everyone's)!

This is what we will eventually move to for deciding who gets paid for working in DevNet!

Brad|Xandeum-imposter DM'ing YouRole icon, XandeumTeam — 12/7/25, 3:39 PM
@DevNet We found a problem with the keypair permissions...

Use this to lock it down.
# Fix permissions on this pNode
sudo chmod 600 /local/keypairs/pnode-keypair.json
sudo chown root:root /local/keypairs/pnode-keypair.json

# Verify
ls -la /local/keypairs/pnode-keypair.json
# Should show: -rw------- 1 root root

# Test that a local basic user can't read it...use your standard username
sudo -u <non-sudo-username> cat /local/keypairs/pnode-keypair.json
# Should show: Permission denied

Expected output:
demo-user@pNode-006:/local/keypairs$ 
demo-user@pNode-006:/local/keypairs$ cat pnode-keypair.json 
cat: pnode-keypair.json: Permission denied
demo-user@pNode-006:/local/keypairs$ 


We'll get that fixed in the installer but in the meantime check it and fix it.
It's only DevNet but need to watch out for these things anyhow and stay vigilant for errors.
Sorry for the oversight on this!
Brad|Xandeum-imposter DM'ing YouRole icon, XandeumTeam — 12/8/25, 7:40 PM
To anyone running a pNode without a pNode license...there is one final step to get it up and running:
Run as root user:
fallocate /xandeum-pages -l 10g
ln -s /xandeum-pages /run/xandeum-pod

This creates a 10gb file, and symlinks it to where the pod software is looking for it allowing pod to start.
It will be added to docs with the next release.

Adjust the size to what you want to allocate and then check the service
This allows it to start to use the pRPC, but does not allow you to be part of the incentivized DevNet payouts.

sudo systemctl status pod.service

Let me know if you see different results.

@DevNet Were ready to try v0.7.3. Upgrade your pNode when available.
cd ~ && wget -O install.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xandeum/xandminer-installer/refs/heads/master/install.sh" && chmod a+x install.sh && ./install.sh

Option 2
Brad|Xandeum-imposter DM'ing YouRole icon, XandeumTeam — 12/9/25, 10:57 PM
Would you guess we have 100TB in @DevNet storage?!
Well we do! With a couple of 15+ TB pNodes!
Can't wait to fill them up!

Brad|Xandeum-imposter DM'ing YouRole icon, XandeumTeam — 12/14/25, 5:58 PM
------

@DevNet Operators, please proceed to upgrade to v0.8.0 at your convenience! 

Run as root user:
cd ~ && wget -O install.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xandeum/xandminer-installer/refs/heads/master/install.sh" && chmod a+x install.sh && ./install.sh

Use Option 2 to upgrade

Check running version after install using either the GUI via port forwarding rules or on the pNode using a script like this one:
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:6000/rpc \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"get-version","id":1}' | \
jq -r '.result.version as $v | "xandminer: \($v) xandminerd: \($v) pod: \($v)"'

xandminer: 0.8.0 xandminerd: 0.8.0 pod: 0.8.0


Please let us know in ⁠devnet-pnode-operations if you have any issues.

@DevNet 

After internal discussions over the past few hours, we are going to reverse the changes that were made to the API syntax. 
Sorry for all of you who responded and corrected your app immediately...I understand it is a pain for you all!
We decided this need to be corrected and understand the significance of making breaking changes.

This will be the New (old) Format:

DevNet API:  https://podcredits.xandeum.network/api/pods-credits
MainNet API: https://podcredits.xandeum.network/api/mainnet-pod-credits

DevNet pod credits : https://podcredits.xandeum.network/devnet
MainNet pod credits :https://podcredits.xandeum.network/

Sorry for the confusion and frustration!

(I am not 100% certain when the changes will go live)

We'll keep continuing to try harder.
