Just FYI, I tried online port scanner, but ports 3000 and 4000 don't respond to that - but, it seems Munich release with "Pod" is around the corner and maybe that will be "pingable" from outside. 
apreston100 — 5/15/25, 8:02 PM
I can use Terminal app on macOS desktop and Termius app on iPhone IOS to monitor a vNode (e.g. typically simple things like sb, sv).  Surely we should be able to do similar for a pNode (I can and do using terminal app), but I am thinking need to somehow setup SSH key and port in Termius for the pNode. Trying hard to learn as a non techie.

There will be nice monitoring of everything, and there will be also app so people won't have to manually open ssh tunnels - just not yet. We are very very early. :-)

🤔 Hm. I'm thinking about if Uptime Kuma can monitor that 4000 TCP port on remote IP address or something. Then again you have to run Uptime Kuma on a server somewhere and expose it through the internet to your iPhone, maybe via a Cloudflare tunnel. Not sure, but I'll be tinkering with it tomorrow.

Great. I only lost track of what services I have running. So I guess there are too many... 
Anyway, you can use it to check if a machine is running and/or if certain services are running on a specific IP address. So if you know your pNode VPS address and add that port number to it, then you should get an "OK" signal in your Uptime Kuma instance that is pinging that port on that IP. 
The same is valid for a local pNode. 
My grammar is getting worse late at night..., that's why I'm editing so much.

I got Uptime Kuma running in my LAN rn. But it is empty at the moment. 
You can organize the services that you are monitoring with tags and in treebrances, iirc.

So, I got it working, and to summarize how to monitor the status of two services (xandminer and xandminerd) on a remote Linux VPS and make the status available over the internet:

Add the following files in the folder /usr/local/bin:
A shell script (check_xandminer_status.sh) to check if the services are running.
A Python HTTP server (xandminer_status_server.py) to publish the response over the internet.

Add the following file to the folder /etc/systemd/system/:
A systemd service file (xandminer_server_status.service) to ensure the Python server and script starts at each system boot.

Set up a local running Uptime Kuma instance to check the server at http://<ipaddress>:8080/check_services every 60 seconds with an HTTP monitor type that has the "Accepted Status Codes" set to 200.

The file contents are generated by AI. I could provide them. 

Not sure if this setup is secure enough. Else you could use Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunneling prehaps, but maybe that is overkill.
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 5/16/25, 8:44 AM

apreston100 — 5/16/25, 8:50 PM
is it necessary for http://localhost:3000/  to have the Daemon Online permanently? I notice it goes off-line if I exit from root@<mypnode> or close my Terminal app used to first ssh to mypnode. In either case the systemctl status on both xandminer and xandminerd show active whether the Daemon is online or offline.
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 5/16/25, 9:21 PM
The GUI itself (3000) and daemon (4000) work only while ssh tunnel for given port is active.
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 5/16/25, 11:42 PM
@apreston100, to elaborate further: 
The GUI and the daemon apps keep running on the server. The 2 ports are only for administrative access control. So the daemon does not go offline, as it has to receive data to be stored, called or erased 24/7 by the blockchain. 
The recommendation is to disconnect whenever you are finished  making adjustments, by closing the terminal that you used to ssh from with the -L option for both ports, so that access will be cut, for security reasons.
So it does not go "offline", it's admin acces is simply cut.

@FrankB76 Your port 22 is not responding, that means either ssh is not running, or you enabled firewall (did you?). In any case, as first step I would recommend - open web Contabo control panel, restart your server, and try ssh again. :-) If that does not help, use VNC connection in Contabo control panel to log in and we'll continue from there.

Hello, trying to convert XANDC to XAND through claim #1 on upgrade.xandeum.network. After connecting the wallet with the XANDC it says that "You do not have any claimable XAND at the moment." Also, I can not see any information about the nodes etc. What do I do?
Zedok

 — 5/18/25, 1:09 PM
The next conversion window will be announced. No date is set yet.
ocd.andy — 5/18/25, 1:18 PM
Thanks Zedok. I got word from a friend that the pnodes need to be onboarded before 31 of may, otherwise risking loosing the "platinum nodes" that were bought. I realise that converting the XANDC to XAND is a first step needed to be completed before going forward of registering and onboarding the pnodes. Or is it somewhere in between I am missing here?
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 5/18/25, 3:24 PM
Platinum nodes are no longer in the mix and have nothing to do with pNodes.
That upgrade portal will not work for you until after the next XandC conversation window (T.B.A.)
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 5/18/25, 3:32 PM
As NeoBubba wrote, don't worry about losing your platinum node, even if you would not onboard your pNode (and this has nothing to do with XANDC), platinum will not be taken away from you. Don't trust that friend very much in the future. :-)
(on the other side, we know that platinum nodes don't have much use anymore, maybe for some airdrop one day?)

Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 5/18/25, 7:57 PM
I'll add: if you are worried about losing your pNode (not platinum) license if you won't onboard pNode until May 31st, that was just reaction to random idea during YouTube/X broadcast, there is no official plan to do that, don't panic. But I would still recommend to at least install and register your pNode, why wait? :-)

I am awaiting equipment to bet my second p-Node up, it is being built right now.
apreston100 — 5/20/25, 2:23 PM
So listening to Ep384 How to Onboard Your  pNode - A Step-byStep Guide  I raise the following: 1. Useful update and alerting of some criteria. 2. I don't recall mention of 31 May 2025 deadline for on-boarding a pNode at time of purchase - where and when was that stated? 3. So if non-onboarded pNodes are going to be auctioned off post 31 May 2025 are you refunding those who purchased but have not yet onboarded? - was this stated as a risk (and binding condition) at time of purchase? - where if so? 4. Under auction what will be the deadline for winning bidders to get their pNode setup and onboarded and will there be a further risk of loss for those who do not? and then another auction ?

Hi! I’m trying to make sure that I’m not missing something. I’m original from years ago when I purchased founders nodes.

Zedok

 — 5/24/25, 7:51 AM
Your founders nodes have generated token which you had access to 50% immediately and 50% vested over twelve months. You can collect the tokens here: https://upgrade.xandeum.network/  If you still have XANDC tokens, you will be able to convert them to XAND when a new window is announced. 
jazzyack — 5/24/25, 3:31 PM
Ok so sounds like I did everything right!  I’ll keep going to collect the tokens on a monthly basis until I hear there’s something more to do.
I just wanna make sure I’m doing everything at the right time. Any idea how to find out what the longer term goals and plans are so I can plan ahead? I wanna make sure I’m also supporting this amazing initiative. That’s why I bought it in the first place.

"The reallity is: There is no spoon" erhm, I mean: no answer. Only an estimation is given by the ones who are doing there  best to provide one. See, we do some of the marketing - spreading the word even further via X and YouTube and there still are a lot of "souls to gain" to gain traction in attention to what Xandeum is actually about and how revolutionary it really is. So I'm fine with "it takes at long as it takes" on that part. 
How long would it take for all of the internet users/providers in world (and the ones floating above it) to realize that they forgot to install scaled, scattered, encrypted storage with a chosen amount of redundancy  on it?

installing authbind - not willing to do that yet ❌;
use the -R option of SSH for a reverse tunnel...
 
The last option - isn't that what we used to do instead of using -L? As we are reverse-tunneling, right?

When using the -R option it responds on the remote machine with "Warning: remote port forwarding failed for listen port 3000/4000". So that is not the issue, I guess.
Then authbind is the thing to learn about.
"It allows a program that would normally require superuser privileges to access privileged network services to run as a non-privileged user." - Wikipedia. 
I guess that would be unwise to use.
