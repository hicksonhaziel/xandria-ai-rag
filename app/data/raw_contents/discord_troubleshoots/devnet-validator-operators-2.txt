I believe I'm in the correct place
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:12 PM
yes... that is the sol home directory... try the rest of those latest commands above.
johnc — 10/3/25, 4:12 PM
run them all again??
or start from a specific step
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:13 PM
do the "rustup" set of 4 again...
johnc — 10/3/25, 4:15 PM
ok, all 4 steps have been rerun
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:16 PM
ok... no errors this time?

NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:17 PM
Oh, and have you rebooted?
johnc — 10/3/25, 4:17 PM
deos not appear so
rebooted? don't I need to move on to step 11?
reboot the server?  or the shell?
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:19 PM
I noticed other guys rebooted at this step, I may have as well but it wouldn't show that.

Reboot the VPS using " sudo shutdown -r now "
And then log back in, go to the sol home directory " cd ~ " and then start at #12
johnc — 10/3/25, 4:21 PM
well that "f"ed things up
I used that command and now I cannot log back in
going to reboot the server now
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:23 PM
Which command locked you out?
johnc — 10/3/25, 4:25 PM
sudo shutdown -r now
getting nothing from the server
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:25 PM
Well, that would have rebooted the server...
Can you ping the VPS?
johnc — 10/3/25, 4:26 PM
Don't know how to do that
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:26 PM
" ping (ip address here) "
johnc — 10/3/25, 4:26 PM
according to my router, it is not there
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:27 PM
Is this a VPS or home setup?  Reboots can take a minute or two...
johnc — 10/3/25, 4:27 PM
home
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:28 PM
Probably still rebooting then
johnc — 10/3/25, 4:28 PM
according to the router the connection type is N/A and the Connection Point is N/A offline
ok, i was able to open a shell.  so, i'm back in
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:30 PM
So that's how long your machine takes to reboot...  take note 😉
johnc — 10/3/25, 4:30 PM
lol, got it
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:30 PM
A "few" minutes... lol
johnc — 10/3/25, 4:31 PM
I think I left off at step 11 from the original instructions
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:31 PM
Yep, start there again.
johnc — 10/3/25, 4:33 PM
I can't remember if I am supposed to change directories or not?  Should I be in sol user or root user
well hopefully I am supposed to be in Sol user cause it is going now
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:37 PM
Sol user... sol home directory
johnc — 10/3/25, 4:38 PM
I hope I am in the right spot I opened the shell and it goes to Sol@xandev43
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:39 PM

johnc — 10/3/25, 4:39 PM
I put in the command and it started to compile 
this may take a few mminutes
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 4:40 PM
Yes, yes it will 🫡
Mine took a while just like they mentioned above...

Coffee ☕️ time 😉 
johnc — 10/3/25, 5:35 PM
first part is done but I got some "warnings"

now compiling the second round
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 5:37 PM
nice... warnings are NOT errors... 🎉
johnc — 10/3/25, 6:36 PM
ok, ran into a problem.  On the second batch of compiling files there was a network error and it disconnected.  I do not have a screen shot of the message from Putty as it disappeared as soon as I touched it.  it was on 937/1049.  Now what?
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 6:44 PM
Hmmm... log back in and see if it is still running?  you can just use " top " to see whats happening like "task manager" in windows
johnc — 10/3/25, 6:56 PM
it is still doing something

johnc — 10/3/25, 7:35 PM

NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 7:36 PM
Seems like there is nothing going on there... you should be able to login and check status again.
johnc — 10/3/25, 7:39 PM
How would I do that or should I start the build over again from the beginning
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 7:42 PM
Just login...  go to sol user...
Check gossip?  I have to find the status command...

strange you are disconnecting from it...
johnc — 10/3/25, 8:40 PM
it crashed my router.  everything is offline.
i need to reboot the server and the router
be back in a few
ok, router is back online
still waiting for the server
johnc — 10/3/25, 8:51 PM
server is up
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 8:53 PM
Hmmm... crashed router?  can't see that being the scripts fault...
It is still running, and showing the old version... I don't think it succeeded.
johnc — 10/3/25, 8:54 PM
no, it did not succeed.  Resrtarting the build
I guess it is possible that my router had an interruption  and caused the build to fail, because everything in the house went offline.
try, try again
johnc — 10/3/25, 10:51 PM
Ok, made it through the build.  It said build complete and followed instructions to restart the validator but it had an error.  See screenshot

NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 10:52 PM
that is the RPC url that is incorrect.  Pretty sure you just need to set it again.

don't know how to do that

copy and paste, and let's see if that solves it.
johnc — 10/3/25, 11:23 PM
looks like it is trying to start
it is waiting for a leader slot
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/3/25, 11:30 PM
Almost...
johnc — 10/4/25, 12:18 AM
ok, I just checked it and it is not tailing.  Although when I do "sv" it shows that it is in the correct slot.
and it shows the updated version of 39e8
looks like it is stuck.  going to reboot the server.
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/4/25, 12:22 AM
Maybe need to run the catchup script? 
johnc — 10/4/25, 12:23 AM
wouldn't it still not tail
somthing is wrong. it is stuck in the same spot.  what is the catchup command??
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/4/25, 12:28 AM
It was a script you should have from the original installation... catchup.sh ?
johnc — 10/4/25, 12:29 AM
Image
it just sits there, that is as far as it goes
it shows me on the correct slot and the correct vote but that's it.

NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/4/25, 12:33 AM
Well, I would go back to the documents and get the extra scripts built.  If I remember there are 3 or them.
johnc — 10/4/25, 12:34 AM
do you possibly have a link to those docs?
NeoBubba

johnc — 10/4/25, 12:47 AM
one more.   I installed the catchup.sh and it seems to be working.  It says that I am 1 slot ahead.  But still won't tail.  I guess I don't really need that
weird
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/4/25, 12:49 AM
hmmm... we can take a look at "logging" tomorrow and see what's up.
Good news is that it is running 👍
johnc — 10/4/25, 12:50 AM
nite, and thanks again
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/4/25, 12:50 AM
You're welcome 🙂
johnc — 10/4/25, 3:56 PM
ok, so it will not tail when I type in the command. any suggestions?
I know it's not a big deal but it is good to check when restarting
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/4/25, 3:56 PM
Which command please?
johnc — 10/4/25, 3:56 PM
other than that it looks like it is running fine
tail -f ~/validator.log
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/4/25, 4:13 PM
I wonder if that file is still the logging file or if it was moved in the upgrade process to a different path...
johnc — 10/4/25, 4:13 PM
no clue
NeoBubba

Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/4/25, 4:15 PM

I was looking at the DevNet data I had collected to date. Thought it was interesting.

-- Transaction Count: Measurement of network activity. It reflects how many developers are testing applications, running scripts, or participating in hackathons. 
-- Block Height: This is a measure of network progress. It is a sequential count of blocks that have been added to the chain, starting from the genesis block (block 0). Each new block increases the height by one (Block n+1 ). Block height is a function of the blockchain's protocol itself, which aims to produce blocks at a regular, predictable interval.

I just this past weekend updated to the new validator version, shout out to NeoBubba.  It no longer tails, but that's no biggie, however the skip rate seems to be high.  Right now I'm sitting at 4.47%.  Any ideas on how to bring that down??? 
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/8/25, 8:19 AM
You can check where the log file is really stored by (if you use "sol" user):
grep log /home/sol/validator-start.sh
So the "tail" command will most likely be:
tail -f /home/sol/data/logs/solana-validator.log 
johnc — 10/8/25, 9:49 AM
Thank you, that command did indeed work.  Appreciated.

david983 — 10/9/25, 8:59 AM
...i'd love to know too but no one's skip rate is looking too great at the mo ..maybe something to do with Ingolstadt rollout?
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/9/25, 9:57 AM
Average skiprate over 19 validators right now is 0.2979%, that looks perfectly normal to me (excluding delinquent ones and one 50%, they cause the avg reported by sv 5.69%). Also remember skiprates spike for a while after new Epoch starts (7 hours ago).
And how to improve - check CPUs in htop, check free space, check internet connectivity (validator makes approx. 10 Mbps TX and 7 Mbps RX all the time), and of course - reboot from time to time! :-)

Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/17/25, 5:15 PM
That's interesting info, I have 27 at the moment (only 1 is my own), but in the worst case, I guess not executed proposals don't "time-out" and disappear...
mrhcon

 — 10/17/25, 5:26 PM
I am unsure about that.  All I know is I need to wait for one of my Xanedum Cliff payments for vNode or pNode to end (Jan 31st 2026) so I can unlock it and then convert all my other Constant locks to Cliff to get them out in another 30 days and then I can accept these payments from Xandeum...  And there are 5 more from them today.  There is not even a warning on the DAO about it and the only why you know is to go into the browser console to see that the lock (or attempted unlock from Constant to Cliff) failed.
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 10/17/25, 5:31 PM
Since Xandeum is running its own "fork" of Realms, maybe if this "31" is defined as a constant somewhere in code, it would be possible to increase it...? But that would require making 100% sure it won't break something, that means spending precious resources... should we create a ticket for this? :-)
Update: Actually... no. The software is updated by Xandeum, but the database is the same, so it needs to remain compatible "both ways". Sorry, false alarm. 
mrhcon

 — 10/17/25, 6:04 PM
I contemplated forking the DAO myself and I did find the piece of code with the limit.  The issue is that changing that limit has many knock on effects.   I really just wished I had known at #30 that #31 was it and would basically lock me out until End of January.  I would have done things differently.
For example, I would have registered multiple wallets with different assets (1 wallet per pNode, 1 wallet for vNode) and any locked XAND in the DAO, I would have put into different wallets. 
I'm just hoping that these DAO proposals that were made available today, will still be there end of February for me to claim.
