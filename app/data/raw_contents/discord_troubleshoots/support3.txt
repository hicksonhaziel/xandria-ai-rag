You can search for "pNode" there and when you click on the results, you should roll open the "Instructions" button and then search for your addres (Ctrl + F is your friend on desktops). Last pNode payout broke up in two parts, so make sure you search in both instruction lists of them.

Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 9/7/25, 4:35 PM
I've got good news - I took your "manager" address from the "seenodes" page, and found it in "June 2025 DevNet pNode payments - Part 2" DAO Proposal, waiting to be executed, go for it. :-) I searched also in all May I found but did not find it there yet.
So, search for your main wallet G11P..., not the pNode address.

Yes you're right I'm pleased to say!! I can see the 10,000 XAND in the DAO locked for 12 months. Many thanks for checking this out for me 🙂

Hi David66, it looks like Substance 2.42 has checked this out for you and resolved the issue (see his Good News post above). I've also been having problems claiming my Xand rewards for running my pnode so I thought I'd send a reply anyway. It does seem quite a cumbersome process to claim the rewards as it involves scrolling through lots of wallet addresses for several 'Proposals' as the pnode payouts are often split up into several Proposals and Additional Proposals. But with Substance 2.42's help I think I've got it figured out now. So we have to go to the DAO and find the Proposal or Proposals for payouts for the month we're looking for. Then click on Instructions. I've found it sometimes takes a few moments to load and sometimes I've had to go out and come back in again before the list of wallet addresses has finally shown. hen I've finally found my wallet address, I've scrolled down and clicked on the Execute button. The key thing I've learned from Substance 2.42 is that although we're looking for the wallet address to receive rewards that we gave on our onboarding form, the rewards don't actually go to our wallets, they go to the DAO and we have to view them there under Governance as they are locked for 12 months.

Role icon, Chat Mod — 9/10/25, 10:12 AM
Because of al those instructions in that list it takes a while to load it in the browser. 
Use Ctrl + F to find your address that you have copied from your wallet or use a "search on page" command on mobile devices. 
In short: 
copy own wallet address
go to Xandeum DAO and search for "pNode" proposals
click the result
open the instruction list - takes a while to load
find your address there (Ctrl + F or "search on page" browser menu option and paste copied wallet address)
find and click "execute" button below your results
confirm transactions in your wallet
check by clicking "View" behind "My governance power" to see it allocated and chilling in Locked Deposits.

TSBP — 9/11/25, 1:40 AM
Why the heck does anyone have to go thru the cumbersome process of claiming the pNode Xand rewards thru DAO proposals in the first place?  There is no vote there.  They were promised rewards for purchasing the pNodes.  Why aren't they just at one of the claimable links on the consolidated participation page?
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 9/11/25, 9:44 AM
You got a great point there. I recon it is possible to make links per wallet and anyone can find their own wallet in a list of those links (for anonymity) - linked to the execution command from the DAO.

Role icon, Chat Mod — 9/11/25, 9:07 PM
Did you registered your pNode to your wallet first?
If you did and did not change anything after restarting pod with systemctl restart pod then use the following lines, thanks to Substance 2.42: 
fallocate -l 10G /xandeum-pages

@apreston100, after that you can dedicate the amount you want on its storage management page. 
apreston100 — 9/11/25, 10:07 PM
I did when setup months ago and dedicated about 90% of capacity at the time.  a df -h shows 100% used though . Don't know why it is full or how to free up space?
Image
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 9/12/25, 5:52 AM
First thing you might want to do is to look at the xandeum-pages file with a ls -lh /xandeum-pages command, to see how big it is. If it is the same size as the storage management page reflects then it is good. Else you might want to delete it and create a small one again with the commands above (fallocate etc.)
Restart pod after removing and creating.
Substance 2.42Role icon, Chat Mod — 9/12/25, 6:19 AM
It shows 5.3G free - I think it's OK, still lot of free space. Just needs regular cleanup like apt remove, apt cleanup, logrotate, journal vacuuming... no immediate action needed right now.
And GUI shows "no more space to dedicate" because... wait for it... there is no more space to dedicate. It purposely leaves 10 GB free. 
apreston100 — 9/12/25, 6:51 PM
OK thanks for explaining. Another aspect I do not quite get is  when I do ls-h at root level it shows these files  10-disable-password-auth.conf  install.sh  nopwlogin.sh  nopwlogin.sh.1  snap  xandminer  xandminerd    on another pNode same ls -h command shows only xandminer  xandminerd    - don't knwo why or if it matters?
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 9/12/25, 8:45 PM
On the first node you have probably followed the pNode guide to the letter and created those files for SSH hardening and disabling password login. On the second you did not, and those options are already integrated in the Xandminer setup menu, so there is no need to do it manually. 
Another thing about Linux: if you say "at root level" you would actually be meaning to say the "/" level (the root) folder, that is the highest level under which other folders gather. You did mean the folder /root/ that is the user-folder for the root admin.
apreston100 — 9/12/25, 9:08 PM
Yes that is correct. Thanks for the reply. So it seems nothing is wrong and I just leave things as they are.

Hi. Interesting. What made the pNode limit?
kryptobiten — 11/21/25, 1:21 PM
When I reach that point I'm told Failed to dedicate more space. And it's not one one. The same limit on all 5 nodes. I got a array with 150TB I want to dedicate. It's no problem of running it that way because next thing you will tell me they can't run on the same machine with same IP. Yes I can run it like that. They run as separate VMs with there own IP.
The other thing I did notice each time I dedicate more space I'm told it will dedicate say 10TB but it actually only dedicate about 400MB så to reach that limit I need to dedicate many times.
kryptobiten — 11/21/25, 1:29 PM
Xandeum now my mail if they want to send mail to me because in registration I told  I will dedicate over 10TB and I suppose I'm alone about that just know. In total on those nodes is there about 87TB dedicated just know.

kryptobiten — 11/21/25, 2:10 PM
No it's spinning with 12 18TB disks with raid 6 or ZFS to make it resonable secure for data. I make backup of file array of the structure of data every ten minutes so If I get currupted data should it be possible to restore and not loose more than nessecary. To make a full backup on those sizes of data start to become diffecult so I have choosen other solution to make it as safe as possible without price going to scyrock. I plan to increase security more but is not there yet.

kryptobiten — 11/24/25, 5:32 PM
I are running multiple dedicated pnodes on Ubuntu 24 VMs with a separate 25TB data disk mounted at:

/srv/qnap/pnodeX (from /dev/vdb via UUID)

Our issue is that this directory grows uncontrollably (currently 16TB used) even when we lower the “dedicated storage” size in the XandMiner UI.
We suspect that old storage data is never cleaned up or rebalanced between restarts and version changes.

Questions:

Does XandMiner / xandminerd ever clean or shrink storage automatically?

Is there an official procedure to reset or clean the storage without breaking the node identity?

Relevant mount:
/dev/vdb (25TB) → /srv/qnap/pnode1 (ext4)
Controlled by fstab using UUID.

We also use a loop device:
/var/lib/xandeum/xandeum-pages.img → /xandeum-pages (20GB).

Correct, No mainnet SOL is required until mainnet for data transactions.
There will be a few things that require some small amount of SOL for gas fees...registering a wallet as a manager wallet or a rewards wallet for example.

        "is_public": true,

        "storage_used": 26069,
        "uptime": 3271,
        "version": "0.7.0"
},


Or is this not a pRPC endpoint? 
Brown — 12/10/25, 7:58 AM
Oh I just saw this response was from before the v7 update 😄

I might still need some clarification on "pnodes" and "pods" tho
Brad|Xandeum-imposter DM'ing YouRole icon, XandeumTeam — 12/10/25, 1:33 PM
The pNode is the Storage Provider Node/Server. Pod is a software that runs on the pNode.
Brown — 12/10/25, 1:50 PM
Okay, I was able to retrive the IPS of like 100 pnodes, most of them were private, about 16-17 public, and those are the only ones I could call the "get-stats" method on
Brad|Xandeum-imposter DM'ing YouRole icon, XandeumTeam — 12/10/25, 2:01 PM
Yes, the public ones have the pRPC port exposed to the Internet. None of them come with any guarantee of uptime or version. So it might make sense to program a function that uses multiple endpoints and run a version where the syntax matches your expectation. 
Brown — 12/10/25, 2:07 PM
Is it okay if I just tag some as "public" or "private" to the user?

Well it provides liquidity and it gives rewards for it in form of XAND and SOL... and you can "unstake" that liquidity by selling it to SOL again or something else.
Zedok

 — 1/12/26, 10:16 PM
Tks. So not much really. So I get less in XANDSOL than the SOL i bought it with.   I can see on the xandsol page how much xandsol I have but is there a way to see how much SOL this corresponds to?  Also, if I sell, will I get back the portion of SOL I lost initially??
Ymetro

Role icon, Chat Mod — 1/12/26, 10:17 PM
I thought there was going to be some more application for those coins, or was it the Xandeum token, that was mentioned in the Foundation brainstorm session a while ago on X?
I would take another look into that.
Zedok

 — 1/12/26, 10:31 PM
Here is another daft thing, I can see my XAND rewards, but where do I find my SOL rewards? I got my answer here: Growing Value: Those rewards are then cleverly woven into the price of xandSOL itself. This means the value of your xandSOL steadily increases over time, reflecting your accumulated rewards.
Unstake with a Boost: When you finally decide to unstake your xandSOL and head back to planet SOL, you'll receive an amount of SOL that reflects the increased value of xandSOL, essentially giving you your rewards all at once!
