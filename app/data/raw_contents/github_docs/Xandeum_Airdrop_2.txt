Executive Summary
The Xandeum team proposes to distribute 60 million XAND tokens through Airdrop 2, structured as three distinct batches of 20 million XAND each. This strategic approach recognizes different forms of community contribution while building the foundation for our mainnet launch.

Batch	Allocation	Purpose	Status
Batch 1	20M XAND	Points Tracker App participants	Ready for distribution
Batch 2	20M XAND	SedApp developers and builders	Rolling as milestones met
Batch 3	20M XAND	Marketing & content creators	Rolling as milestones met
Timeline: Upon approval, the merkle distributor will be created within 2 weeks. A second DAO vote will be required to fund the distributor from the treasury.

The Three-Batch Structure
Why Three Batches?
Over the past years, we've built something special together. Xandeum's Storage Enabled Decentralized Apps (SedApps) represent a fundamentally different approach to blockchain applications—one that combines Solana's speed with practical, real-world storage capabilities.

But technology alone doesn't create ecosystems. People do.

This proposal recognizes three critical groups who will help us transition from testnet to mainnet:

Early community supporters who believed in our vision
Developers who will build the applications that showcase our technology
Content creators who will help the world discover what we've built
Each batch serves a strategic purpose in our path to mainnet, and each represents a different way to contribute to Xandeum's success.

Batch 1: Points Tracker Participants (20M XAND)
Overview
The first 20 million XAND will be distributed to participants in our Points Tracker App who engaged with Xandeum through various community activities.

Eligible Activities
✅ Watching Xandeum and Blockchain Bernie YouTube videos
✅ Engaging with X.com posts from Xandeum (likes, follows, shares)
✅ Participating in the Xandeum Discord community
✅ Other genuine community engagement activities
Important: Referrals Removed ⚠️
All referral points have been removed from eligibility.

Based on lessons learned from Airdrop 1 (which distributed 60M XAND entirely based on points), referral programs were heavily exploited and did not bring us legitimate, engaged community members. We've refined our approach to reward genuine participation rather than gaming the system.

Distribution Formula
To ensure a fairer distribution curve that benefits a broader range of participants, allocations will use a square root formula:

User Allocation = (√(User Points) / Total √(Eligible Points)) × 20,000,000 XAND
Why the square root? Airdrop 1 used a simple linear distribution, which heavily concentrated tokens at the top. The square root formula helps prevent extreme concentration and creates a more equitable distribution across all genuine participants. Those with moderate engagement still receive meaningful allocations, addressing a key lesson learned from Airdrop 1.

Status
✅ Ready for immediate distribution. The Points Tracker data is finalized and the merkle tree can be generated upon approval.

Token Vesting Schedule
All Airdrop 2 tokens include a vesting schedule to ensure long-term community alignment:

4-month cliff: Tokens cannot be claimed for the first 4 months after distributor funding (~120 days)
12-month continuous linear vesting: After the cliff, tokens vest continuously every minute over 12 months (~365 days)
Claim anytime: You can claim your proportionally vested tokens at any time (not monthly steps)
After 1 day of vesting: claim 1/365th of your allocation
After 23.456 days: claim 23.456/365ths of your allocation
After any amount of time: claim the proportional amount vested
Total vesting period: 16 months from distributor start (~485 days total - all tokens fully vested)
Grace period: Days 486-610 (~4 additional months) provide extra time to claim your fully-vested tokens
Claim deadline: 20 months after distributor start (~610 days), all unclaimed tokens return to DAO treasury
Evolution from Airdrop 1: Airdrop 1 had 12-month linear vesting with no cliff. Airdrop 2 adds a 4-month cliff period to further encourage long-term commitment and reduce immediate selling pressure.

Example Timeline:

Day 0: Distributor funded, vesting begins (start date)
Days 1-120: Cliff period (no claims possible)
Day 121: Vesting begins - can claim 1/365th of allocation per day elapsed
Day 150 (month ~5): Can claim ~30/365 of allocation (~8.2%)
Day 242 (month ~8): Can claim ~122/365 of allocation (~33.4%)
Day 365 (month ~12): Can claim ~245/365 of allocation (~67.1%)
Day 485 (month 16): Fully vested - can claim 100% of allocation
Day 610 (month 20): Deadline - unclaimed tokens return to DAO treasury
Important: Tokens vest continuously by the minute, not in monthly steps. You can claim multiple times or wait and claim all vested tokens at once.

Claiming Process
Visit the official claim interface at https://airdrop.xandeum.network
Connect your Points Tracker App wallet
Verify your total allocation amount
After the 4-month cliff, claim your proportionally vested tokens (vests continuously by the minute)
Claim any time during the vesting period, multiple claims allowed - claim 1 day's worth, 10 days' worth, or all vested tokens
Must claim before 20-month deadline (~610 days)
Anti-Gaming Safeguards
Wallet Review Process: Wallets displaying patterns suggesting abuse or system gaming will have their allocations held back during the initial Batch 1 distribution.

Appeal Period:

Flagged wallet owners will be notified and given an appeal period
Users can provide evidence of legitimate participation
Appeals reviewed at the team's sole discretion
Successful appeals result in allocation release
Redistribution: If appeals are unsuccessful, held-back tokens will be redistributed proportionally to legitimate airdrop recipients, ensuring rewards go to genuine community members.

This process protects the integrity of the airdrop while providing fair recourse for legitimate users who may be incorrectly flagged.

Batch 2: SedApp Developers (20M XAND)
Overview
The second batch rewards developers who build functional, innovative Storage Enabled Decentralized Apps (SedApps) on Xandeum's infrastructure.

Why SedApps Matter
SedApps are what differentiate Xandeum in the crowded blockchain space. They're not just smart contracts—they're full-featured applications that leverage both Solana's compute and Xandeum's storage capabilities.

Developers who build these applications will:

Demonstrate real-world use cases for our technology
Attract users from the broader Solana ecosystem
Create the foundation for sustainable network revenue
Prove that Xandeum solves actual problems, not just theoretical ones
What Qualifies as a SedApp?
Technical Requirements:

Deployed on Xandeum mainnet (required to demonstrate real users with economic value)
Utilizes Xandeum storage capabilities (not just Solana compute)
Functional with real users and demonstrable economic activity
Open-source or verifiable code for security review
Documentation included (setup, usage, architecture)
Note: Development and testing can occur on Xandeum DevNet, but final deployment to mainnet is required for Batch 2 eligibility. This ensures applications have real users and create genuine economic value in the ecosystem.

Examples:

Decentralized social media platforms
NFT marketplaces with metadata storage
Gaming applications with persistent state
Data archival solutions
Decentralized content platforms
File sharing applications
Any innovative use case combining compute + storage
Allocation Structure
Developers earn XAND tokens in addition to any bounties they receive. This dual incentive structure recognizes that early ecosystem builders take on extra risk and help establish best practices.

Typical allocation ranges:

Small projects/tools: 50,000 - 200,000 XAND
Medium applications: 200,000 - 1,000,000 XAND
Large/complex platforms: 1,000,000 - 5,000,000 XAND
Exceptional projects may receive larger allocations subject to DAO approval.

Frequently Asked Questions
General Questions
Q: When will the airdrop happen?

A: Batch 1 within 2 weeks after the second DAO vote passes. Batches 2 & 3 on a rolling basis as projects/content are approved.

Q: Why three separate batches?

A: To reward different types of contributions—early supporters, developers building applications, and creators spreading awareness. A complete ecosystem requires all three.

Q: How is this different from Airdrop 1?

A: Airdrop 1 was also 60M XAND tokens, but was distributed entirely based on points alone. Key differences in Airdrop 2:

Three distinct batches serving different purposes (vs single points-based distribution)
No referral points (removed after exploitation in Airdrop 1)
Square root formula for fairer Batch 1 distribution (vs linear distribution)
Rolling distributions for developers and creators (Batches 2 & 3)
Community voting on developer and creator allocations
Two-vote system for transparency
Enhanced vesting (4-month cliff + 12-month continuous linear, vs Airdrop 1's 12-month linear only)
Q: Airdrop 1 was 60M tokens for points—why is Airdrop 2 divided into three batches?

A: Airdrop 1 taught us valuable lessons. While 60M tokens based solely on points rewarded early participation, we discovered:

Referral gaming diluted rewards for genuine participants
No developer incentives meant fewer applications being built
Limited ecosystem growth beyond point accumulation
Airdrop 2's three-batch structure creates more strategic value:

Batch 1 (Points): Rewards past participation with improved formula (no referrals, square root distribution)
Batch 2 (Developers): Incentivizes building real SedApps on mainnet with actual users
Batch 3 (Creators): Drives awareness beyond our existing community
This approach maximizes ecosystem impact rather than repeating the same points-only model. Each batch strengthens Xandeum differently, creating compounding value for all token holders.

Q: Airdrop 1 excluded certain jurisdictions like the USA. Does Airdrop 2 have the same restrictions?

A: Airdrop 2 is fundamentally different from Airdrop 1 in structure and classification. While called an "airdrop" for simplicity, all three batches represent rewards for valuable contributions to the Xandeum ecosystem:

Batch 1 (Points): Compensation for past participation, engagement activities, and community building efforts
Batch 2 (Developers): Payment for building functional SedApps deployed on mainnet
Batch 3 (Creators): Compensation for creating content and marketing materials that benefit the ecosystem
Unlike Airdrop 1's broad geographic restrictions, Airdrop 2 takes a different approach for all batches.

Important Considerations:

Your Responsibility: Participants in all batches are responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and tax obligations in their respective jurisdictions
Independent Business Decisions: By participating in any batch, you are receiving compensation for contributions to the ecosystem. You should evaluate your participation as you would any professional engagement and make informed decisions about your involvement
Legal and Tax Implications: Consult with qualified legal and tax professionals regarding your specific situation, as regulations vary by jurisdiction and individual circumstances
Sanctioned Jurisdictions: We will continue to restrict participation from OFAC-sanctioned countries and other jurisdictions where we are legally required to do so
Recommendation: Before participating in any batch of Airdrop 2, we strongly encourage you to seek professional advice regarding any legal or tax implications specific to your jurisdiction and personal circumstances.

Batch 1 Questions
Q: How do I know if I'm eligible?

A: If you participated in the Points Tracker App through genuine engagement (videos, social media, Discord), you're likely eligible.

Q: What happened to my referral points?

A: Removed. Airdrop 1 showed referral systems were exploited and didn't bring genuine community members. We're rewarding real engagement instead.

Q: When can I claim?

A: Tokens have a 4-month cliff (~120 days) before any claims are possible. After the cliff, tokens vest continuously every minute over 12 months (~365 days). You can claim your proportionally vested tokens at any time - after 1 day claim 1 day's worth, after 23.456 days claim 23.456 days' worth, etc. Must claim within 20 months (~610 days) or tokens return to DAO treasury.

Q: What wallet do I use?

A: The same wallet connected to your Points Tracker App account.

Q: What is the vesting schedule and how does it work?

A: All Airdrop 2 tokens (all three batches) follow a 4-month cliff + 12-month continuous linear vesting schedule:

Day 0: Distributor funded (your vesting start date)
Days 1-120: Cliff period—no tokens can be claimed (~4 months)
Day 121: Vesting begins—tokens vest continuously every minute for 365 days
Any time during vesting: Claim your proportionally vested amount
Day 485: Fully vested (100% claimable) - ~16 months total
Days 486-610: Grace period to claim your fully-vested tokens (~4 extra months)
Day 610: Claim deadline—unclaimed tokens return to DAO treasury (~20 months total)
Important: Vesting is continuous by the minute, not monthly steps. After the cliff ends, you can claim at any time based on days/minutes elapsed.

Example: If allocated 12,000 XAND:

Day 121: Vesting starts - can claim 12,000 × (1/365) = ~32.88 XAND per day vested
Day 151 (30 days after vesting started): Can claim ~986 XAND (30/365 of allocation)
Day 243.5 (122.5 days after vesting started): Can claim ~4,027 XAND (122.5/365 of allocation)
Day 485 (365 days after vesting started): Can claim all 12,000 XAND
Can claim multiple times or wait and claim all at once
Claim by Day 610 or tokens return to treasury
Q: Why does my wallet show as flagged or held back?

A: Some wallets displaying patterns suggesting system gaming or abuse are held back for review. You'll receive notification and have an appeal period to provide evidence of legitimate participation. Appeals are reviewed at the team's sole discretion. Tokens from unsuccessful appeals are redistributed to legitimate recipients.

Batch 2 Developer Questions
Q: What counts as a SedApp?

A: An application using both Solana compute AND Xandeum storage. Not just smart contracts—full applications with storage capabilities.

Q: I already got a bounty. Can I still participate?

A: Yes! Batch 2 allocations are in addition to bounties. We especially want to reward early builders.

Q: How much can I earn?

A: Varies by project scope: 50K-200K XAND for small tools, 200K-1M for medium apps, 1M-5M for large platforms. Exceptional projects may receive more.

Q: Who approves my project?

A: Hybrid process—Xandeum team reviews technical merit, then DAO votes on shortlisted projects. Both required.

Q: Can I submit multiple projects?

A: Yes! Each is evaluated independently. Quality over quantity encouraged.

Batch 3 Creator Questions
Q: What content qualifies?

A: Tutorials, explainers, blog posts, social campaigns, infographics, podcasts, case studies—anything that promotes Xandeum or showcases SedApps with quality and reach.

Q: Does audience size matter?

A: It's ONE factor. Smaller creators with engaged audiences and quality content can outperform large creators with low engagement.

Q: Can I submit existing content?

A: Yes! We want to recognize creators who believed in us early.

Q: How much can I earn?

A: Varies: 10K-50K for individual posts, 50K-300K for series, 300K-2M for major campaigns, 500K-3M for sustained programs.

Q: Can I get recurring allocations?

A: Yes! Sustained quality content can result in multiple approvals or milestone-based distributions.

Technical Questions
Q: What is a merkle distributor?

A: A smart contract that enables efficient, fair token distribution using cryptographic merkle trees. Gas efficient, verifiable, self-service, and transparent.

Q: How do I claim tokens?

A: Visit the official claim interface at https://airdrop.xandeum.network, connect your wallet, verify allocation, click claim, approve transaction. Tokens vest continuously after the 4-month cliff period - claim any amount of vested tokens at any time based on days/minutes elapsed since your cliff ended.

Q: Is the distributor audited?

A: Yes, based on battle-tested open-source code and reviewed before deployment. Details provided before second vote.

Q: Can someone steal my allocation?

A: No. Only your wallet address can claim your specific allocation.

Timeline Questions
Q: What's the complete timeline?

Now: Community reviews proposal
Week 1: First DAO vote
Week 2-3: Merkle distributor creation
Week 3: Second DAO vote
Week 4: Batch 1 claims begin
Week 4+: Monthly review cycles for Batches 2 & 3
Q: How long will Batches 2 & 3 stay open?

A: Until each 20M allocation is exhausted. Based on anticipated submissions (~2 large, ~10 medium, ~20 small projects per batch), we expect the rolling distribution to continue for several months. The actual timeline will depend on the quality and quantity of submissions received. High-quality submissions will be prioritized to ensure the best use of ecosystem resources.

Security Questions
Q: How do you prevent multiple accounts?

A: Verified wallet connections, demonstrable work products, team reviews for suspicious patterns, community voting, blockchain analysis. Violations = disqualification.

Q: How do you prevent plagiarism?

A: Require verifiable links/repositories, check for copied work, timestamps matter, community can flag suspicious submissions. Violations = immediate disqualification and blacklisting.

Q: What prevents team favoritism?

A: All approvals require DAO voting, public evaluation criteria, transparent reasoning, community can reject recommendations, all votes recorded on-chain.

DISCLAIMER: This appendix uses simulated sample data for demonstration purposes only. The user counts, point values, and distribution amounts shown here are hypothetical examples designed to illustrate how the Linear vs Square Root formulas work mathematically. This does NOT represent actual Xandeum user data, real point balances, or final airdrop allocations. Actual distributions will be based on real Points Tracker data and may differ significantly from these examples.

Overview
This appendix provides a detailed comparison of the Linear vs Square Root distribution formulas across 100 hypothetical sample users with simulated points ranging from 1,500,000 (highest) down to 350 (lowest). This is for educational and illustrative purposes only.

Formulas
Linear Distribution
User Allocation = (User Points / Total Points) × 20,000,000 XAND
Square Root Distribution
User Allocation = (√User Points / Total √Points) × 20,000,000 XAND
Understanding the Square Root Formula
This section breaks down the Square Root distribution formula piece by piece, showing exactly how the math works and why it creates a more equitable distribution.

What is a Square Root?
The square root (√) of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives you the original number.

Examples:

√100 = 10 (because 10 × 10 = 100)
√10,000 = 100 (because 100 × 100 = 10,000)
√1,000,000 = 1,000 (because 1,000 × 1,000 = 1,000,000)
Key Property: Square roots grow much slower than the original numbers. When you double a number, its square root only increases by about 41%.

Example:

100 points → √100 = 10
200 points (2× more) → √200 = 14.14 (only 1.41× more)
400 points (4× more) → √400 = 20 (only 2× more)
This "compression effect" is what makes the square root formula more equitable.

Step-by-Step: How the Formula Works
Let's break down the formula into its components:

User Allocation = (√User Points / Total √Points) × 20,000,000 XAND
The formula has 3 main parts:

Part 1: Calculate Square Root of User's Points

√User Points
This converts the user's raw points into a "compressed" value that reduces the gap between high and low earners.

Example:

User with 1,000,000 points: √1,000,000 = 1,000
User with 10,000 points: √10,000 = 100
Gap reduced from 100:1 to 10:1
Part 2: Calculate User's Percentage Share

(√User Points / Total √Points)
This determines what percentage of the total allocation the user should receive, based on their compressed (square root) points compared to everyone else's compressed points.

Example:

User's √Points: 1,000
Total of all users' √Points: 51,482.70
User's share: 1,000 ÷ 51,482.70 = 0.01942 (1.942%)
Part 3: Apply Percentage to Total XAND Pool

× 20,000,000 XAND
Finally, we multiply the user's percentage share by the total XAND tokens available for distribution.

Example:

User's share: 1.942%
Total pool: 20,000,000 XAND
User allocation: 0.01942 × 20,000,000 = 388,400 XAND
Complete Calculation Example: User #1
Let's walk through a complete calculation for User #1, who has the most points.

Given:

User #1 Points: 1,500,000
Total Points (all users): 10,017,835
Total √Points (all users): 51,482.70
XAND Pool: 20,000,000
Step 1: Calculate square root of user's points

√1,500,000 = 1,224.74
Step 2: Calculate user's percentage of total square roots

1,224.74 ÷ 51,482.70 = 0.02379 (2.379%)
Step 3: Apply percentage to XAND pool

0.02379 × 20,000,000 = 475,774 XAND
Result: User #1 receives 475,774 XAND

Side-by-Side Comparison: Linear vs Square Root
Let's compare how User #1 and User #50 are treated under both formulas:

User #1 (1,500,000 points) - Highest Points

Linear Formula:

Step 1: Calculate percentage
1,500,000 ÷ 10,017,835 = 0.14973 (14.973%)

Step 2: Apply to XAND pool
0.14973 × 20,000,000 = 2,994,600 XAND
Square Root Formula:

Step 1: Calculate square root
√1,500,000 = 1,224.74

Step 2: Calculate percentage
1,224.74 ÷ 51,482.70 = 0.02379 (2.379%)

Step 3: Apply to XAND pool
0.02379 × 20,000,000 = 475,774 XAND
Comparison:

Linear: 2,994,600 XAND (14.973% of pool)
SQRT: 475,774 XAND (2.379% of pool)
User #1 receives 84% less under SQRT formula
This doesn't punish User #1 - they still get a substantial 475K XAND!
User #50 (15,500 points) - Middle Tier

Linear Formula:

Step 1: Calculate percentage
15,500 ÷ 10,017,835 = 0.001547 (0.155%)

Step 2: Apply to XAND pool
0.001547 × 20,000,000 = 31,056 XAND
Square Root Formula:

Step 1: Calculate square root
√15,500 = 124.50

Step 2: Calculate percentage
124.50 ÷ 51,482.70 = 0.002418 (0.242%)

Step 3: Apply to XAND pool
0.002418 × 20,000,000 = 48,401 XAND
Comparison:

Linear: 31,056 XAND (0.155% of pool)
SQRT: 48,401 XAND (0.242% of pool)
User #50 receives 56% more under SQRT formula
The XAND redistributed from top users benefits middle-tier participants
Why This Formula Works
The square root formula achieves three key objectives:

1. Compresses the Gap Between High and Low Earners

The square root function naturally reduces extreme differences:

Points	Linear %	√Points	SQRT %	Gap Reduction
1,500,000	100.0%	1,224.74	100.0%	Starting point
150,000	10.0%	387.30	31.6%	3.16× better
15,000	1.0%	122.47	10.0%	10× better
1,500	0.1%	38.73	3.2%	32× better
As you can see, lower point holders get an increasingly larger percentage under the SQRT formula.

2. Maintains Top Contributor Recognition

Even with compression, the top user still receives:

20× more than the median user (User #50)
44× more than the bottom user (User #100)
This ensures meaningful rewards for high contributors.

3. Creates Meaningful Allocations Throughout

Every participant receives an allocation that feels worthwhile:

Top 10 users: Average 374,646 XAND each
Middle 40 users: Average 204,110 XAND each
Bottom 50 users: Average 161,782 XAND each
Even User #100 with only 350 points receives 10,690 XAND - a meaningful amount that encourages continued participation.

The Math Behind "More Equitable"
Here's exactly how the redistribution works mathematically:

Total XAND to Redistribute: 20,000,000

Under Linear Formula:

Top 10 users control: 12,478,040 XAND (62.39%)
Everyone else shares: 7,521,960 XAND (37.61%)
Under Square Root Formula:

Top 10 users control: 3,746,464 XAND (18.73%)
Everyone else shares: 16,253,536 XAND (81.27%)
Net Effect:

8,731,576 XAND redistributed from top 10 to remaining 90 users
That's 43.66% of the entire pool being redistributed to create fairness
Per User Impact:

Each of the top 10 gives up: 873,158 XAND average
Each of the bottom 90 gains: 97,018 XAND average
Visual Representation: The Compression Effect
Here's how the square root "compresses" the distribution:

Points Distribution (Linear - Exponential Gap):

User #1:   |████████████████████████████████████████| 1,500,000 pts
User #10:  |████████████| 450,000 pts
User #50:  |▌| 15,500 pts
User #100: | 350 pts
Square Root Transformation (Compressed Gap):

User #1:   |████████████████████████████████████████| √1,500,000 = 1,224.74
User #10:  |██████████████████████████| √450,000 = 670.82
User #50:  |█████| √15,500 = 124.50
User #100: |█| √350 = 18.71
XAND Allocation (More Equitable):

User #1:   |█████████████████████████████| 475,774 XAND
User #10:  |████████████████████| 260,565 XAND
User #50:  |███| 48,401 XAND
User #100: |█| 10,690 XAND
Notice how the gaps between users become much more reasonable after applying the square root function!

Key Findings
Redistribution Effect
Top 10 Users (Highest Points):

Linear: Receive 12,478,040 XAND (62.39%)
SQRT: Receive 3,746,464 XAND (18.73%)
Impact: -70% allocation, redistribution of 8.7M XAND
Middle 40 Users (15,500 - 400,000 points):

Linear: Receive 6,030,160 XAND (30.15%)
SQRT: Receive 8,164,416 XAND (40.82%)
Impact: +35% allocation, gain of 2.1M XAND
Bottom 50 Users (350 - 15,500 points):

Linear: Receive 1,491,800 XAND (7.46%)
SQRT: Receive 8,089,120 XAND (40.45%)
Impact: +442% allocation, gain of 6.6M XAND
Break-Even Point
User #38 (38,000 points) is approximately break-even in this example:

Linear: 75,888 XAND
SQRT: 75,697 XAND
Difference: -191 XAND (-0.3%)
In this simulated example:

Above 38,000 points: Users receive less under SQRT formula
Below 38,000 points: Users receive MORE under SQRT formula
Note: The actual break-even point will vary depending on the real distribution of points among all eligible users. This example demonstrates the general principle of how the square root formula compresses the distribution curve.

Maximum Impact
User #100 (350 points) shows maximum benefit:

Linear: 815 XAND
SQRT: 10,690 XAND
Benefit: +9,875 XAND (+1,211.7%)
This demonstrates the SQRT formula's power to ensure even participants with modest engagement receive meaningful allocations.

Visual Distribution Comparison
Top 10 Users

User #1 (1.5M points):
Linear:   [████████████████████████████████] 2,994,600 XAND
SQRT:     [██████] 475,774 XAND
Difference: -84.1%
Mid-Tier User #50

User #50 (15,500 points):
Linear:   [█] 31,056 XAND
SQRT:     [██] 48,401 XAND
Difference: +55.8%
Lower-Tier User #90

User #90 (850 points):
Linear:   [▌] 1,816 XAND
SQRT:     [█████████] 12,980 XAND
Difference: +614.8%
Conclusion
The square root formula creates a significantly more equitable distribution while still rewarding top contributors:

Top users still receive substantial allocations (475K XAND for #1 in this example)
Mid-tier users see 35-55% increases in allocations
Lower-tier users see 200-1200% increases, making participation worthwhile
Break-even point at ~38,000 points ensures fairness across the spectrum
This approach maximizes community goodwill while preventing extreme concentration at the top, creating a healthier token distribution for long-term ecosystem growth.

Remember: The data shown in this appendix is for demonstration purposes only. Actual allocations will be based on real Points Tracker data and calculated using the same square root formula principles illustrated here.
