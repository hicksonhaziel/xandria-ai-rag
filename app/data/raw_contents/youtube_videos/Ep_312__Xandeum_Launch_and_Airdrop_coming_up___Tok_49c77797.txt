TITLE: Ep 312: Xandeum Launch and Airdrop coming up - Tokenomics Explained
================================================================================

312 exciting times ahead the launch of the xand token is scheduled for October 29th our airdrop number one is scheduled for October 29th as well we will be listed on dexas and we will be listed on centralized exchanges as well we're aiming for Mexi and bit and yeah these are exciting times we have tokenomics finalized the tokenomics community feedback um window has finished so I'm going to go through all of these tokenomics in this little video with you and show you what you can expect what you can expect when you want to start staking with a liquid staking pool uh to earn some free Zan tokens what you can expect to get air dropped with these Zan tokens and let's just dive right into it so this is our website um not our website this is xandum foundation's website and um you know the launch is being shephered by uh by xandum Foundation they are launching the uh storage enabled staking reward so if you've missed out on my last video where I explain what storage enabled staking is watch that past video so now there is a learn page here right and we have several sub Pages here and one of these is the xan toonomic so that was uh that's what xandum Foundation has in store for you but they also have all these other other pages about the vision the storage layer the launch timeline the docks and they have a special validator page right so but if we click on that learn here just right in top um you get all these things here the the vision is to make web 3 ubiquitous and Spark that Cambrian explosion of web 3 apps so that has been our North Star um all along and um that has been our goal so there was that um um previous project which is now called xandum classic which tried to achieve that goal with um an L1 of its own but now we are transitioning to that Solana scaling solution and we find that super super exciting scaling salana and is scaling salana even necessary well salana already is super super fast with regards to transactions per seconds and all that kind of stuff but it does not scale with regards to storage capacity and that what we are doing and by that we will um make that Vision a reality click that learn more button here learn more about our vision and the Cambrian explosion how it happened with Earth and how it happened uh with the blockchain the big bang was Bitcoin the dawn of life was ethereum and we are setting out to spark that Cambrian explosion because suddenly web3 devs have that huge file system at their disposal with our um salana scaling solution all right and here's the storage layer so everything's explained here um with uh this this architecture diagram and all that that Peak poke proof Paradigm that we have how it works uh seamless integration with salana all these type of things so we are super excited about that and here's the launch timeline so the press release is out um and the token upgrade announcement this should R token upgrade announcement was on September 20th um community feedback uh we were at breakpoint final xan tokenomics the notes are cut off will be on October 3rd so that's for the old solution zium classic and then the airdrop snapshot will be happening on October 8th all right so all the points that you collect up until October 8th will be used for the airdrop number one xandum Foundation has set aside 60 million tokens for the airdrop number one and those will be shared equally among the points holders there will be an upgrade window for the ones that have already the old sandium classic solution and uh there will be the grand launch on October 29th all right so what else do we have here the tokenomics right and that's what I want to go through with you today so here are the xand token tokenomics that the zum Foundation has come up with and that has gone through that feedback round right so let's start right here in the bottom we have 15% allocated um to the team and to to the early team several team members and that includes quite a reserve around you know 34% roughly of this team allocation is being reserved for future team members um so we need to have that Reserve to hire world class talent coming up all right so then um we have the zand classic holders 11.8% so there is that window where um people that have the old token from the from the previous project now called Zan classic they might be able to swap it one for one um and um yeah there's quite a discussion going on on our Discord it's F to see that so many people think they um there was something uh not enough for them or things like that so I would say this Pro this project guys must be a paradise for you getting into it right now because all the old guys think like oh the new guys get way too much compared to us so it might be a great project for the new guys to jump on all right so and then we have the air drops here we have five air drops right and this isn't shown here um in in uh in all of these here airdrop number one is just one5 of this total allocation addir drop number one is 60 million tokens and then here we have some odd numbers because the max Supply is 4.15 Zan tokens and that's just to keep it um in sync with the max Supply that we had for the old solution so we use exactly that same Max supp Supply 4.15 and um so these percentages here are rounded to uh to one decimal after the decimal point so the exact uh token numbers you can really find on chain or stuff like that we might post them somewhere but these are you know a one decimal they are not exact and we have a foundation Reserve managed by the zum foundation and then there is the community da Reserve managed by the da and this da is kind of important to understand because everyone that owns that new Zan token right including the guys that upgrade their old tokens for the new token they are part of this Dao the Zan token is the governance token for the Dao and this da will receive everything that the xandum network is doing right the store storage stuff will be powered by that Dow right so all the storage layer all the programs that we develop the the the xandum salana validator software the xandum salana RPC software it all collects these extra extra fees indefinitely not only until 2032 as it was with the old solution it's going to do that indefinitely oh by the way this is saying not Financial advice right so just for the records uh because here it says like natural ad or something like that so it's not Financial advice everything in this video on my channel in general is not Financial advice I'm not a financial adviser and I don't know your personal situation so but um with the um um with the tokenomics here um a large large share is is managed by the da so everyone that gets the token does kind of not only hold their own token but also controls the others and tokens that are here in the Dow um and and you control what's happening to these and all the rewards that come in for storage and for liquid staking you know with the commission that we take right part of the rewards will be given to the stakers to the validators to the P noes and you know they do all the work so that the platform can work um but everything that's stays for the platform goes into the Dow there is no centralized organization there is no like xandum Labs getting some stuff and and and things like that there will be development companies that develop the software they will get um obviously uh compensated for the development work but as the platform works it's in the Dow it's run by the Dao and the foundation who is you know a member of the Dao the foundation has these all these xan tokens here but you own everything here and compare that again to other projects so as far as I can look into jeto I see it's a it's a great governance token um they do a lot there and uh but I can see that their their liquid staking is flowing into into that Dow and you participate on that with the GTO token what I cannot see maybe I'm missing it but to me it looks like you know the me rewards like 4% or 6% of those go to jeto and they just go to jeto they don't go into the da or the foundation where the token holders would profit off of it right so with the jeto token you're only participating in the liquid staking at least as far as I understand it correct me if I'm wrong in the comments um so that means the the tokenomics are here way way better and let me walk you through all these uh individual positions here um we have this here so here's the mint address so you can type this into uh Sal scan or any other Explorer you will see all the um um all the token uh allocations to the different sub accounts um and um 4.0 one5 billion is the max Supply we estimate on day one about having about 580 million of these circulating after 12 months we estimate to have 851 885 uh circulating and those are all numbers published by the xandum foundation so Foundation is expecting this the mint address is this one so you can find it on our on on zum foundation's website z. Network I have that mint address check it out in explorers the minting is disabled so nobody will be able to Mint even a single xan token anymore all right so we have the the dowo treasury Community Building These funds will be spent to grow our community um egva calls key opinion leaders advertising Community Management Services we do ecosystem development pay for small development tasks that add to our ecosystem Community grants reserve for projects that the foundation wants and offers grants for teams to implement um and and staking rewards those go to the liquid staking as extra rewards because when you liquid stake you can earn these extra rewards and I can only repeat recommending come to xandum network early on October 29th to liquid stake your soul because you will get a lot of Zan tokens for free on top of the high staking rewards so we will give out Zan tokens and these extra rewards extra xan rewards will be boosted by a factor of 10x if you come early while the pool is smaller than 30,000 tokens right so um that said um if you like more information like this please smash that Thumbs Up Button uh subscribe to my channel it really helps and it also gives you points you can still collect points because remember the snapshot is on October 8th so still time time all right so what else do we do um we have funds for liquidity providers and and market makers and then the zansi holders I talked about these I talked about the team talked about the airdrops and the foundation reserved there a market maker so we're working from day one with reputable market makers um talking with some of these um cannot tell you the names yet because um the order is not yet placed but very much we want to start with professional market makers on day one we have funds set aside for uh strategic Acquisitions of small companies and teams furthermore the Zan Foundation has funds set aside here to um build the storage layer so these tokens here the zum foundation will use them to sell them on the market if Market permits and pay for building the storage layer so that we can finally launch that um operation here and um and then we have marketing operations day-to-day marketing task that will be paid out of this um um allocation all right so so far my intro to um the xandum tokenomics we find these really exciting um we also think that for the old token holders the xandum classic um we have you know through their swap um they can gain a lot the swap is optional so if they don't want they can keep their their xandum classic as well and um I think for everyone you know completely having this solution run by the da right not by some there is no centralized organiz think of Hive mapper right very popular in in in the um in the industry right they have their tokens that people earn when they drive through the street with their with their cameras and and and you know help map all the streets but then it all goes into a company into just a regular centralized company that sells this data of with a credit card for US Dollars and just Pockets the profits right this is not happening here you as the xan token holders and the xandum foundation is a large token holder also but that's you know all transparent here in the in the tokenomics but otherwise other than the developing companies behind that there is no centralized organization that runs this and would kind of pocket the running profits that come out of both the storage layer and the liquid staking this all goes into the Dow and profits all of the token h that are in there and we find that super super exciting um it's a very very nice uh scheme that AUM Foundation has come up with in my view uh not Financial advice but at least I would recommend you to check out um their tokenomics join all their channels take part in the discussion that's going on and be ready for October 29th um to do the staking and the uh and the token Lo and um hopefully uh buy some tokens uh on on day one all right thanks so much for watching guys catch you later peace
