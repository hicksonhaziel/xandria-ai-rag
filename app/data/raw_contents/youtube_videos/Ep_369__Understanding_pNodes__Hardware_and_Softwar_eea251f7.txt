TITLE: Ep 369: Understanding pNodes: Hardware and Software Breakdown
================================================================================

we are back with Bernie and Sean here talking about what's happening with xandum and guys we got to get into that how this thing is actually going to get rolled out because I get the penals are super important I know that we want to get them all over the world but how do we get there yeah so it all starts right now in March 2025 March 25th is the big day when you will be able to run a p Noe on our devet right and we do that all in errors it's the Deep South error the first error now we going to have 300 P noes in devet you will be able to buy them in our P note store for 35,000 zand that is less than um less than $100 you can buy zand on any exchange for now for now absolutely and we've been going you know upwards against the trend for for for a week or two now so that was really nice to see um and um and get these P noes they are limited to 300 in the Deep South era then we're going to have the South ARA which is the complete prototype we're going to have like a th P notes there so that's 700 more then we go to the mine era which is a big big thing with the Frankfurt release the first one in the mine era that's about a minimum viable product so we will be out there on mainnet then and we will have our own apps like that Wikipedia decentralized Wikipedia alternative um out there but then the devet will stay right and then at some point after the mine error it's going to be the central error and in that Central error we're going to build out the the whole bft between the P noes so it's all going to be made blockchain grade um we you know where we make it um f tolerant not only only against crashes but also against potentially Mal malicious players that you know put a PE note out there and try to alter the data and stuff like that and in that in that era um the devet will transition into a testnet okay so you've bought your your right to run a p note in in devet it'll automatically transition over to our test net and the difference between a test net and devet is the test net will mimic main net circumstances all right so with the main eror we're going to be starting with uh with main net and then in the central eror right after that we will have our test net up there and your license that you buy now will automatically transition over and then we will see how many P noes do we have on Main which of course depends on adoption and how many apps will be there how much will they store and stuff like that but if it takes off which we all assume and and build for it'll scale up right and if we have like those exabytes or even zettabytes of storage someday who knows when we're going to be there but hopefully within a few years we will need close to a million of penos and and if we grow after it's going to be millions of penos right and we need that same amount in testing so if we come up with new releases we want to test it in lifelike scenarios right that's what salana has right now they test that looks pretty much like their main net just with one release ahead right one software release ahead so so that's how it's going to going to develop there and then and then we still might have a once we transitioned from devet to testnet we still might have a devet with like 10 P noes or 100 P noes and we might just operate those ourselves but what you do now when you get into it and buy a license to run P noes on devet they will automatically transition over to testnet and as you see it in all the other um blockchain projects right if you're there from from the early days you have your devet node now that it will become a test net node you need stake on your if you run a p node on mainnet which will be permissionless you don't need buy anything right it's a permissionless uh system um but you will need stake on your on your on your P note in mayet in order to earn money right because your your your earnings will be uh proportional to three factors right the storage you provide the performance and the reputation and um and the stake right so being early there just puts you in a position to you know where there's not many people out there there's not many other P noes out there so people will stake with you and stake is surprisingly sticky I can tell you that right and I know it from my own Sal of validator that I'm running right there are so many people out there that just have I don't know millions and millions of dollars that they just stake with some validator they St it and then they forget it they're you know of course they're kind of the the the the cheap skates I love that word learned it recently from the English language um you know they they always go you know oh I can get you know 100 10 basis points more there and there and then they stake somewhere else um but that's also a little bit disincentivized because you always lose one Epoch of rewards right which is just two days on so and it will be on xandum as well but if you constantly try to cheap cheap skate then you're you're going to be missing out two days every time you so yeah yeah so and that's the reason uh a steak is really surprisingly sticky and you know that's the real reason for getting into this P Noe um Adventure as early as you can and you know I'm not the one that can make that dream come true for you right I'm not guaranteeing you anything it's a it's a big decentralized chain I can only talk about what I observe in in other chains right there's salana validators I will never get four million soul with my salana validator as the early guys have right and and you see it in Aptos right I personally know a guy um here in Vegas um that that is running one of those early apas nodes right I will never get into that right it's just it's just how it usually turns out right and um don't sue me if it doesn't because it's your business right running a PE note is a little business yeah right and I I a lot of nde node Runners right myself included I'm a terrible Trader like I just don't have the time if I can set something up and like you said stake it forget about it and just earn passively long term that's a much better way to go about it but tell me how do I get this thing set up how how easy is it to get a panil up and running yeah so we have our our our doc documentation um set up and you just go to to that page you need to be up to date with everything be on our email list be on our Discord be on our X so we will um publish it in the next few days most likely it's already up when you watch this video and and there's the documentation and it's like you you need that Ubuntu Server Ubuntu machine where you inst thate it could be a little computer that you have in your home right um and it's very very possible to run these things from home because it's low Hardware requirements you just need reliable and fast internet um but you can also do it in a virtual private server a VPS and um the requirements are so low that we found one provider uh called contabo they offer that VPS for $5.50 wow month um we don't want everyone to go there so it needs to be decentralized right I I'll run my home don't worry yeah so so so that's a great thing and and 550 a month and and that'll suffice for quite a long time on on devet right and and it might even later on in mainnet right maybe a little bit of a larger VPS instance and things like that but there there won't be czy C Hardware requirements on on for PES and those virtual servers are always upgradeable too which is nice because I don't for see our storage that we're using today being the same storage that we're using you know a year from now things do change things do need to get upgraded and that's just how you know technology Works we're always you know going to the next thing um how but then but then you just go through those docks and it's as simple as getting that instance you know downloading our software and then it sets up everything for you it hardens your your Ubuntu instance so that uh you know password login is disabled it sets up a tunnel for you a secure tunnel uh via SSH which is one of the most secure protocols out there um so that other people can't um access your guey to manage your P Noe right everyone has their own P Noe and it's all securely tunneled and um that's all automatic and then once you're in there and you see that xan minor guey it's as simple as it gets right you you see automatically it scans your drives how many drives do you have there what's the free space how much of that free space you want to dedicate um to the xandum network uh you can generate your key pair as simple as click that button that says generate key pair then you have it there and there's a register button you can register your P Noe and then there's a web page where you see all the P noes that have been registered so you will see your yourself there with your public key and and that app will get upgraded over the releases to show you your performance score and everything um that you that you make with your P you just said performance score how do you gauge what's a good or bad you know P Noe yeah so that's also a good question and also that will evolve over the different releases and the Aras that we're building it in the very beginning In The Deep South era you just need to be there right in in the South era you need to be up uh 24/7 right but we won't we won't measure the transfer speed or the latency or stuff like that that will come then in in the M era where uh we will check your speed the correctness of your response the um the latency um and all these type of things right so and if there's any like you're not responding at all even after whatever a second or so then that's going to drive down your your reputation score right now that I'm telling that it really um reminds me of my safety score that I have on my Tesla app right I recently decided to to go Tesla insurance with one of my cars and and they measure that safety score and you pay insurance month by month by that safety score don't you drive past 10 p.m. yeah that's they made it 11:00 p.m. now but if you drive late night yeah it'll it'll penalize you right so it's it's it's a similar thing yeah it will be that and also that Tesla safety score it evolves right they had 10 p.m. now they listen to user feedback they made 11: p.m. and many other things they used to have like aggressive acceleration in there people didn't like that many people buy a Tesla because they can accelerate 0 to 60 in 4 seconds right I got one yeah so they took that out and the same here right the performance and reputation score criteria or just like with the credit score right it it changes like every month or so right it's it's it's always different criteria uh for the scoring things so we will learn as we go but it's going to be about you know uptime and uh correctness of response and and speed and latency and transfer speed and and these type of things how would the community be able to contribute to you know these parameters long term like who's going to Define what a good P note is let's see even after you know mayet launches yeah so that's a great question it's all it's all governed by our da so we have that Dao governance there and our Dao is one of the most powerful you have the one of the most utility of any salana project with Ard da and that is it it it it even has the update upgrade keys for all the programs that are involved right so the Dow can literally introduce new releases of any of the piece of software that we have in the zum Network um and uh also all the rewards that are that are um being collected after 94% are being sent to the P noes um 4% is going directly into the Dow treasury right so that means the xan token holders z xan x and the xan token holders have the full governance power they have the the the full econ they capture the full economic benefits um of that whole platform and yeah I love it that's so great when you actually get to have the community have a say um it's very different than the world we're living in right now where if you want storage from anybody it's got to be one of the big centralized ESS it's going to be gradual though so I need to mention that um in the beginning the zum Foundation has a lot of xan tokens that they could use to vote but most of the time they just recuse themselves and let the community vote um and and we will give more and more power to the community but the whole mechanism is set up right now right it's it's that Dao is there it's just that um the Dao has a council so there might be some Council votes where the community is not even as and even if the community is asked the zum Foundation still has a lot of these tokens but both of these things will gradually be reduced once the software is really there and we launch on mainnet and you know gradually it will be fully fully Community owned and fully Community governed I I love that gradual aspect of it just because it allows us to be able to find the right node Runners the people that are going to be committed you get to find the people who actually want to be part of this network and want to contribute so you know doing things overnight never a good idea so finding the right people to actually contribute and be part of it I think is super important and yeah gradually is the way to go let me let me reiterate on that too Rome wasn't built in a day right so you know it's going to take time to build this out and to get the community going and the community whether you want to participate deep and be a node Runner or just hold some xan tokens you can be a part of it doesn't matter how deep you want to get into it you can start with the low barrier of Entry but just know that the more more you put in the more you get out yeah no that's absolutely true I love that love that term node Runner that we just coined somehow right it was mention if you it reminds me of a road runner huh oh there we can we can play with that I know you like names we're gonna we're going to fit that in somewhere I'm sure node Runners reminds me of tradear pending there you go H all right big question how can people get involved and get that get that node and I believe you said it's March 25th yeah it's March 25th and um that's when our P Noe store is going to be opening and uh in some of my videos on the blockchain Bernie Channel there is a sneak peek on how the PE note store looks like and um yeah you need to stay updated you need to be on our Discord and on following us on X uh following both xandum Network and Bernie Bloom uh AKA blockchain Bernie on uh on X and and on YouTube and um and the email list is also super important and then uh once we get closer to the launch uh in just a few days um you will get all that information and it's going to be on the xandum network website as well and also on the zum.com um people sometimes ask me what's the difference between these two websites so the xandum the xandum network is the whole decentralized thing and there is a foundation there the xandum foundation that manages all this and zum n network is their website it's the foundation's website xandum domcom is for xandum labs xandum labs is a US company that just develops the software for the zum Network got it yeah very cool well guys uh this has been super exciting really excited to not only you know see this thing launch but get myself a note as well because I definitely not only want to see where it goes I want to be part of this evolution of web 3 absolutely you should I absolutely will thank you so much and yeah I can't wait to see it come out all right apprciate it
