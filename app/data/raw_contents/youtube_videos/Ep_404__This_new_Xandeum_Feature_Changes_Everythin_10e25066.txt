Hey, hey, hey everyone. We're here in the Cayman Islands and as promised, we are opening the office of the Xandium Foundation here and I couldn't be more pleased to have the new director of Xandium Foundation here on the Cayman Islands with me, Dr. Anthony Bl. >> Yes. Hi everybody and welcome to Cayman Islands. My name is Anthony Blenn and I am the new director here in Cayman Islands. I have been here a couple of weeks now and looking for an apartment. I found something and uh yes, a little bit about myself. I grew up in in Sweden. Um I studied medicine in Germany in Gingan. It's a famous university where a lot of uh Nobel Prize guys have been working and um >> he he's working on it. Yeah, I work >> getting the Nobel Prize for >> So, and after that I I worked a couple of years as a medical doctor in Sweden and even as a doctor on cruise ships from Miami out into the Caribbean Sea. And later on I moved back to Germany and started my own businesses in uh the healthcare in healthcare so to say in in outpatient care and uh what is it called? Yes, I forgot the name now. And uh >> retirement homes. >> Retirement homes. Yes. Sorry. Sorry. Yes. So in retirement homes, I've been working in this field for over 30 years and um I've been my own CEO and I have been those have been my own businesses. So I have experience in running businesses but I'm not a technician like Bernie next to me here and now I would be responsible for the foundation here in Cayman Islands. >> Yeah. So we couldn't be more lucky to to have someone with this amount of business savvy and you know it was as I as I understand it was a big kind of chain of of retirement homes. It was not just one or two, it was a bunch, right? And um and um yeah, doing all this successfully that that takes a lot of business savvy. And um Anthony, what what uh made you interested in in Xandium or its predecessor, Bku back in the day? Yes, I actually started being interested in in in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2023 through the crypto club. And yes, on the homepage from the crypto club, Burley introduced the PTO offering in 2023. I think it was in April, May 2023. and uh I thought it was an interesting project. So I had some contact with Bernie and I decided then to meet Bernie in person in Breakpoint Salana Breakpoint in Lisbon 2023. That was the time when FTX crashed and and yes and after that I thought this was be would be a really great project for me as well to participate. So I invested in the platinum nodes and P nodes and during the years here I've been a couple of times in Vegas to to learn more about the company and the project and yes now I'm sitting here as the new director. >> Yeah. Yeah. And also we couldn't be more lucky to have someone with kind of a history in the project. So you've been through thick and thin with Pichoku and Xandium and also as I like to say have a vested interest in in the whole project right so he has supported all the Xandium uh project a lot over the years um which is awesome and um yeah now here as as the director of Xanium Foundation and um yeah what are what are your your next steps here? what what um what do you plan to do with within the Xand Foundation? >> Okay, it's it's actually to to continue the project that is already uh going on now and the one is the rewards program to automize that. So the rewards will be paid out uh regularly. So we're working on that. And and the second thing is the foundation ex foundation sanium delegation program for the rewards for the penote owners in the future. >> Those are the big projects and of course later on to support every new ideas to have apps on the on theandium network and we've been working here with Bernie for a new thing. He mentioned it already yesterday in a short video called crosshairs and we were working on this project and I believe a lot in this and that's al also what we are being working on now these days in in here on Cayman. >> Yeah.
