TITLE: What Powers Xandeum: A Technical Deep Dive
================================================================================

so we obviously understand that there's a huge huge need for a storage layer but H how are we going to get there what does this thing actually look like Bernie we're here we're talking about how zum is changing the landscape not only for salana but what three as a whole what will the storage layer look like yeah great question thanks for for asking that so after the first video that we had that was all about the why and why we're building that and you know that which is all important to me I always start with the Y in my life um now what are we actually building right and we were talking about the storage limitations and the only place you can store stuff on salana is and salana accounts right so we need to break free from that right also salana accounts always have a redundancy of 3,000 you know every piece of data that any developer stores in Solana it's always stored on all 3,00 validators and they all need to keep it in Ram right that's a lot of replication that's a lot of replication and um so what we are building is a second tier of these salana accounts it looks like we want to make it as much like salana accounts as we can because the developers are used to that you know they they they know what salana accounts are um but also they are used to the normal programming model outside of blockchain and what do do we have there for storage usually we have something what's called file systems right file system is something that we all know with our computers and stuff so it is um it is basically like a path right you have like users action docs something with the slash or on Windows of backslash in between I'm sure people remember the C col SL SL then the path you want to get to right file explorer exactly yeah there we go does yeah yeah and and that's a file system right and you can create files you can delete them again you can edit them you know you can you can modify something in the middle of the file um you can create directories and remove directories and all that's what I call random access right and that's not there in any of the storage projects that are out there on on on blockchain on like filecoin R weave R weave you can't even delete anything it's just archival right that's that's the problem that they are solving right that's not making smart contracts more versatile it's not they are not solving that problem and they don't set out to solve that problem right even filecoin is not designed to make smart contracts more versatile and to create new types of apps it was not the point of filecoin right it was just storing something and making it like decentralized right but it's not making the smart contracts in any way more versatile so in that way what we're building here is super super unique we're building a kind of a world file system right and That Is Random Access it scales to exobytes and more because that's what we need we need to scale the capacity of storage because the accounts are so limited and um yeah that's what we're building here in the file system model an opening file and positioning the read right head within a file and overwriting stuff in them that's what people have been used to since the 60s or so right and and that's a well-known programming model and we bring that to blockchain and why do we do that in order to spark that Cambrian explosion of all different types of web 3 apps that are not there today now what does it look like though because is it going to be one of those things that it becomes super cumbersome that it's going to be out of the reach for most people or is there going to be a uiux that actually makes sense for end users oh yeah so right now we're working on the xan miner and that xan Miner is super user friendly super gooey friendly you know think of think of any app right now what app isn't user friendly if it's not user friendly it's not being used I mean it's in the it's in the word itself so we're making sure that anyone your grandma your your kids anybody can do it you know it should be that easy and that's what we're going for here yeah and that's very different from like running a salon validator right it's tough and you need technical skills and it's all command line but since we need millions of P noes storage provider nodes in the end right it has to be super user friendly we cannot you know have Grandma use the Linux command l or something right people talk about scalability all the time but Step One is scalability is making sure that everybody can actually do it yeah so back to what we're building right so in the end if if someone builds a zandian a xandum enabled app on salana they'd have to go through a special RPC nodes so usually all those apps they just send their transactions to RPC nodes think of RPC nodes as kind of access nodes to the blockchain this now for a xandum app it has to be a xandum enabled RPC node so it's a salana RPC node but that's running our specialized our modified software so usually the salana RPC noes just run the Solana validator software and we have a modified version of that that understands the X transactions right so we love this x transactions because it can mean two things it can mean xandum transaction but it can also stand for extended transaction which is which is what it is right it can access the storage functionality it goes into that RPC node we will provide these xandum enabled RPC nodes in the beginning but there might be other RPC providers out there and we're already talking to some that want to xandum xandum enable their RPC nodes and then that's just a very small modification and then we have a sidecar process that's called dock so that's running on the same computer that runs the RPC node and it's called the dock because it docks to our storage layer right it's kind of the the the mediary between the validator software on the RPC and the xandum storage layer and we made that as a sidecar on the request of the sauna validators they want to not have huge modifications in the validator software and they don't want to um you know open New Ports or stuff like that they want to have that side car there that's kind of independent and they are independent with the releases and stuff like that so yeah so what would it look like for a current Salon validator to you know start becoming a storage provider through zenium yeah good question um there's two aspects to that one is if that Sona validator is also running an RPC node then that would mean installing the modified version and sending things off to the dock um the RPC models the RPC nodes the business model is very different from a validator because the RPC nodes they sell subscriptions right to to apps that are running out there and that's like for larger companies or at least some companies that that want to provide RPC noes the other hand is the the salana validator they can get xandum enabled also and they can challenge the P noes right because we want to make sure that the P noes do what they're supposed to do store all these all that data so in our software we can uh generate proofs and Merkle proofs of you know that they actually do what they're supposed to do and the validators help sending challenges to those P noes they just say hey what's in your file this and that at position 7,846 and then the next 512 bytes right that's a challenge and and they need to respond back of course this is all encrypted it's based mer proof and all things and um and um yeah that's something where validators will be able to uh make additional revenue and and get additional rewards just by participating in challenging our PE noes no I know that it's very tough for you to become a salon validator not only are the requirements high as far as Hardware is concerned but also requires a lot of salana what what do people need to you know run a xandum node yeah so you know it's like that's a great question you we're at the very early days of xandum right and when I look at for example salana from you know four years back or so when they just started with their main net until today right the ones that were there in the early days they had the first validators they got all the stake because there weren't that many valid Val ators right and I know so many people I you know I know a lot of these Salon of validator operators personally cuz I meet them on the salano breakpoints and everywhere and we're we're on Discord all the time and there are so many guys right just really normal guys they haven't built a company or anything right they were just there back in the day they have 4 million s in stake and that literally means they make seven figures in hard US dollars each and every month not year right so just for sitting there and running that validator just setting it up many of them are really active in the community right I mean they they don't they don't you know hang out on some Island all day they engage in in governance and all these type of things I mean they're they are all great guys right and um but yeah they didn't have to go through all the hassle of building a company with tens or hundreds of of employees and everything right they were just there and you know I think the P noes are the core of that whole zium storage ler right they will do the whole the the the the Lion Share of the work the the the heavy lifting and they will get the Lion Share of the of the storage rewards right so think of that like when the when the instructions come through from the xandum transactions those apps have to pay fees they pay the salana fees today but they will also have to pay the fees to store the data in the zium storage layer over 90% of these fees go directly to the P noes that do the work right they will be able to share it with their stakers they will be able to share it with um the validators that challenge them and all these type of things but most of these rewards will go directly to the P notes and you know if that whole storage layer is successful and we're going to store exabytes or even zettabytes of of of data one day we will need millions of these P noes all over the world and they are small computers they don't need a lot of CPU they don't need a lot of ram but you know they need as much storage as possible because your rewards are proportional to the storage that you provide and they need good internet connection because we need to be fast right and and keep in mind these pees can be ran by anyone so you don't need to be too much of a techie to be able to run them but this is meant for the masses yeah absolutely so it's really exciting to see where we've come so far the need that we've obviously identified how you guys are actually creating these things to make it happen but I want to know little the how for the people so stay tuned we're going to be right back with you with another episode covering exactly how you can get into this
