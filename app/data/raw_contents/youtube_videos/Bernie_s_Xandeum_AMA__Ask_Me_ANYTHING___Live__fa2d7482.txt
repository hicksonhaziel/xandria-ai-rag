TITLE: Bernie's Xandeum AMA: Ask Me ANYTHING! (Live)
================================================================================

hey hey hey everyone blockchain Bernie here uh broadcasting live from fabulos Las Vegas this is my AMA um ask me anything so um let's see this is using um this is using YouTube's uh chat function here so you guys can uh uh can ask me questions uh live live here so um yeah maybe someone can try uh type something so that I can check my technology out here and see if we're back into um into ask me anything um yeah but I don't see anyone here so uh yeah so the this AMA is mainly about the upcoming P node launch right so we are finally launching our PES the provider nodes they do the actual heavy lifting uh hi Wonders of the World um the actual heavy lifting of um of storing the data and we're going through all of our uh different eras and I love the fact that we have this all planned out right so the first era is the Deep South era it only has two releases right it has the constants release and the fryberg release we're already working on the fryberg release right now the constants release will be the one that you guys will be using first um on on our xandum devet running your P noes there being able to register them and with the fryberg release we will be able apps like you know experimental apps that that that we're doing um around the building they will be able to create their file systems to create the world and um wh every every storage lives in and they will be able to destroy it again and you know since our commands have like um a little bit fancy names like the peak and poke um that that you guys already know um creating our universe creating that file system for one app where everything lives in um we call that command Big Bang and to destroy it again we call that armagedon right so we have a little bit of figurative um nice names for our commands and um yeah and then after that it's only two releases in the Deep South era then we have the South era and that starts with the Munich release and the Munich release actually is a little bit of a larger release because it has everything it has all the um um all the different um commands like the peak and poke the paging and everything will actually work the the P noes will actually store stuff so it is a full working prototype of the whole thing right so that's going to be really really awesome we hope to be there um within a ail right so let's see but fryberg release will come really really soon we have the launch date for the P noes it's a March 18th for VIPs and March 25th for um non-vips right so we have about 320 people that signed up for the VIP list uh back in the day they have a full week of Head Start and um there's going to be a 300 P noes in total um it's Max a maximum of three p noes can be purchased per wallet and um we want to have as much diversity of course as possible and uh as many P Noe operators as possible um and yeah so that's what it's all about and um there are a few before you guys ask your questions let me just tell you the few things that kind of the known um uh uh known bugs here the the known things that we don't know how to tackle them yet so one is like if all 300 might be sold out just from the uh just from the VIP uh owners Alone um I don't know if that's going to happen or not like likely it won't but I'm not sure right we'll see um what do we do then well there need to be some for um for the uh for the non-vips as well so we might limit it for like 200 for the VIPs and then um have the remaining 100 um there or it might be different numbers so we still need to figure that out can't tell you that yet but you'll see it in the P note store and you'll you'll see it in in the emails in our Discord and right here on and and on X and everywhere um uh how the final decision will be um then um yeah okay so good we have a few guys here so let's see uh what I have here um Baba seim I missed air drop one when air drop two going to happen we don't have a date yet so we absolutely focus on building at least you know launching the P notes building the concept the fryberg and then the Munich release that's our absolute priority and that is good for you because as we're building we of course expect also the xan token to gain some value we had some nice um um a nice push like about 36 hours ago um Zan token went up like 26% and it might have a connection to the upcoming Pino launch who knows Market are sometimes weird you never know what the reason is but I assume we can kind of bolster the price of the Zan token significantly um with um with with you know actually shipping software here right and that's what it's all about and I had so many people asking me like hey Bernie you promised that and the early node owners will have this and that you know we need to make this project happen right and you guys can help you can be engaging with our stuff on X on on YouTube and spread a positive vibe right so all engagement that's like and you know it's sometimes human right some people have like they are they are unhappy with this and that and they spread it out in public and they repeat it like 75 times that this and that is crap and that doesn't help right it's we we want to because I know we're all excited about this project and I I all keep repeating we have the best community in the world and we need to let that shine through that's how that's how we make this project um successful right okay so then maybe it is one hour later no it was uh oh 1 hour later no we announced it for 10:00 a.m. Pacific um today right not uh not 9:00 a.m. um it's a little bit out of the ordinary right it's a Saturday not a Sunday and and we're doing it at 10:00 a.m. so yeah that is that uh we have rul here hi Raul uh key to know your opinion about um simy 228 you you know 72 to8 is kind of a a really really controversial um subject here um my first gut feeling is like man that's going to be bad for stakers it's going to be bad for validators and I didn't like you know the tone that Anatoli has tweeted about it it it was not it did not resonate with me right but if you really think about it we need something where the inflation rate adjusts with um with the staking participation um we need more defi participation and all these type of things so my thought is I will likely like you know likely vote for it but I'll give myself a few more thought I was kind super busy with yeah developing of the xandum uh software here and our releases and the Pino launch so I didn't have too much time to think so much about 228 I will vote against um 123 though um simd 123 um I I don't think we need that we need kind of block rewards sharing in the Bas protocol because we can do it in liquid staking and the xandum liquid staking and the zanol also quite successful recently we're you know constantly growing slowly but constantly growing um likely have already past the 33,000 s level uh as of now I'm not sure so let's have a look at that and um and uh so that's that's happening there also let me just see yeah it's 32,9 32 so we will be passing the the 33,000 uh threshold really soon and still have the best apy everywhere so I love that one so as with uh that was the question about simy 228 when airdrop 2 we don't know yet I I understand that question there will be an airdrop 2 um but likely together with the Munich release right like in April is um we never know maybe you know whenever the Munich release is ready that's going to be a big big big milestone for us it's it's going to be huge right because it's a full working prototype of the whole solution and um that's be a good time to kind of connect the adrop to with um can you explain the connection with the p noes and staking um or which three points are essential for the operation of a p Noe that's a great question wonders of the world and um I made the you know and this is all changing with the erors that we're going through right in in the Deep South era when we start those P noes it is it is different right but what I give you now is the end Vision right it should be there by the M ER right by the Frankfurt release then we should have that end vision and here's the endv vision right so there are three factors that determine the total rewards of a p Noe and on Main net right I'm talking on Main net what we're doing right now with the Pino launch is the Pino's inet so you also need to understand that two different worlds right devet and the devet might transition into an an incentivized test net at some point in time so that's one world right but I'm talking about the real world the main net when we launch it on mainnet and we will do that um with with the launch of the the Wikipedia alternative that we're building um in the main era or mine eror and um so again that means the end Vision on Main net the P noes yeah in in in xandia mayet for the end Vision they will be earning dependent on three factors right the amount of space provided the amount of storage space that's absolutely clear if you provide 10 terabytes you earn 10 times as much as someone that that provides one tbte all other things equal right so so the more storage you provide the more you earn right the second is the performance score right it the performance score goes hand inhand with the reputation score right so how that performance and reputation score is going to be calculated we don't know yet it's on the road map right we're going to have fee markets at some point in time we're going to have um performance monitoring at some point in time and that's when we figure that out so never forget that we're not talking about something that's already there and you can ask all sorts of detailed questions and we already have the answers it's not like that we're building it and we're building it in public we're building it with you and with your support so um that's the that's the awesome thing about this product this project right so we have these three factors storage space provided and then performance SL reput ation score right and how that score is being calculated it might be changing all the time it's the same with credit scores here in the US right it changes every two weeks there is a different algorithm on how your credit score is being calculated right and with that performance and and um and reputation score it's going to be the same we need to be sure that we reward the people that behave well um run reliable nodes um have no history of trying to cheat or anything and and all these things right so all that will flow into that performance score or reputation score and um it'll develop over time right but that's the second thing right so we have the amount of space provided we have the performance and reputation score and then um the third thing is the stake that other users delegate to you and that's where it becomes a little bit tricky because right now staking your Zan tokens goes with the dowo right and you can earn high apy on your xan tokens if you stake it to the Dow but here's the thing um you know at some point we need to have these Zan tokens being staked to P notes right so you don't stake it to our da anymore you will in the future at some future release stake it to panotes and then there is a big problem because somehow we also want these guys to be able to vote in the Dow right we don't want like oh you stake it to a p note then you don't have your xan tokens in the Dow anymore and you can't vote anymore that would be crazy we want and need that vote participation in the xandum Dao as well so we just will figure that out and that's a big you know unknown as of now I just can't give you the answer um but we want both and we will find a solution to do both and it might be a little bit of an effort on our end right but we want both we want voting in the Dao not sure if we can stick with Realms then Realms is that software that's mostly used on slana uh for Dows and you know it's a little bit difficult to do both St taking and voting and everything at the same time it already feels a little bit not 100% integrated with what we're doing right now and we need zand staking for those P noes because those P noes need to have to lose something right so if they don't perform or they just stop working or they try to cheat or alter the data or you know try to use just one drive even though they they they say they have five or something like that right then they need to have something to lose so that you know concept of staking if we don't have proof of work right we need to have proof of stake and and all the modern blockchains have that and the the P noes offer storage blockchain grade right in order for that to be blockchain grade and temper proof and censorship resistant all that kind of stuff we need people to stake their Zan tokens to specific PE notes right the same way it happens on any proof of stake blockchain and and smart contract chain like salana like ethereum like cardano you name it all the others right so it will be like that in the future yeah I don't know when you know some sometime around midy year um it will will be that your main net P note and you will be if you if you participate in the devet with the p note you have that Head Start people know you already right people see your names in all those discords on X when you talk about P noes and and you can educate them and and if you contribute to the ecosystem in some way doing some great documentations maybe doing your own videos or just have an ex uh Channel where you explain everything and you just show off your competence competency on on on running these P noes people will start staking with you naturally and there won't be that many in the beginning right so that's how you can put yourself in a position like the early participants in the salana network that now have 4 million soul in stake and I know so many of these um personally and I've talked to them face to face on on on different slana events right uh that are now making seven figures in hard US dollars each and every month just by having those 4 million soul in stake so that is the opportunity that is presenting itself here and no Financial advice and it also doesn't depend on xandum in any way it depends on you on running your validator providing that running your P Noe providing that storage having that good reputation score and and you know marketing yourself as a good uh PE note operator so that you can get that stake um early on but for now you know no stake for the P noes we're we're starting in the devet with the devet p noes only in the devet P noes rewards won't even be um proportional to the amount of storage provided it will just be one p note it has to meet a minimum performance requirement just being online and um and uh and it's not not dependent on stake in the beginning and then we will move through the errors the uh the the the math behind um W how much rewards will there be for the devet nodes it might change and at some point you know we transition from the devet into the test net and then if if we have like say 100,000 P noes in main net we also need to have 100,000 P noes in test that just to be able to do performance tests and all these type of things when we do new releases so your devet nodes might just transition into test net nodes and um and these things but the real the real thing is you want to gain experience with this you want to make yourself a name um for when we go on on mainnet and as I mentioned mainnet will be there sooner than we think um because we're we're going to be launching that Wikipedia alternative as soon as we can on an MVP minimum viable product around the middle of this year okay that was a long answer uh to a question here so um P noes and staking yeah and the three the three nodes I hope that answers your questions Wonders of the World um then we have Aero hi Bernie a rod for those with stranded zansi what options are available to safely uh participate well we're we're doing um another zansi upgrade window um it should have actually started yesterday but I needed honestly uh we were busy with some other stuff uh so I need to talk to my devs if it's really open but it should be open by Monday to the latest and then you have like one and a half weeks or so um to upgrade your zansi to zand one for one and um you won't be disadvantaged against the ones that already converted their zansi back in October right so you will already have around like 68 or 70% of your of your new Zan token already unlocked and then the rest will vest over these what is it like nine months or so that we have that are still open out of that original 12 months period right so watch out for that sansy um upgrade window we will have one right now um so that you can convert your Zan C to zand um before the um before the upgrade window uh how do we get the xand C Zan C is xandum classic so that's the thing of the past there's no way to get Zan C uh anymore it's just people that that did participate back in the day in the old chain they have Zen and they will all convert it um into zand so zans C has no significance uh anymore these days that's all about the zand token uh Cornell how many P noes can one wallet buy uh we scaled it down to three we had a discussion on on Discord so thanks everyone for being so engaged on Discord and on X and everywhere I would love to have more of these discussions also going on on X right so if you really have any question questions ask me on on X and on on xandum so on X with the blockchain Bernie account on X and also the the xandum network account on X so um and it it used to be 10 per wallet we scaled it down to three per wallet now right there's no point in having so many sibles we want to have as many you know really uh different persons or companies for for what what it's worth um to run all all these P noes so we're limit limiting it to three per wallet then we have mby X here how can new users go ahead with the p noes process so there we will announce that on everywhere on this you need to be on Discord you need to be on X and follow us and and just follow all the updates and then within the next few days we will open the P node store I already gave you a sneak peek into the peot store in my videos right here on on YouTube and um and yeah all you need is get these Zan tokens 35,000 Zan per P Noe um which is less than $100 hope it's still less than $100 even though the Zan token went up a little bit since I announced that and um yeah you need those 35,000 Zan you can buy them on Jupiter you can buy them on Mexi if if you prefer that which is a centralized exchange um or just go to Jupiter and and swap your Sol or swap your usdc uh for zand and then you need to have that in your wallet you always need to have a little bit of soul in your wallet just to pay for the transaction fees and then come to our P Noe store there's no link yet so you need to be updated uh stay stay up to dat here and follow us everywhere and then there will be a link there will be a date and time on March 18th uh when everything's starting and uh yeah then you can go ahead with the p note sales and we're going to have the docks up and running as well probably even earlier the docks are kind of quite good and and then you need to have a computer right and and Ubuntu a computer that has like at least 100 GB of storage you need to dedicate at least 64 GB to the zum Network and then you need some more to for your operating system and stuff so let's say like you need like 100 GB um at least and um and you need to have at least I think two gigs of RAM or such it's all all the requirements are laid out in the documentation um and we found providers that do it in a data center in a virtual private server uh for just $550 a month right so we just recommend going with these and it's all uh set out in the in the docks that are going online uh really really soon [Music] so hindo would we still have the opportunity to swap from Zan to zansi yeah I uh I answered that already we don't have the window the the zansi upgrade window open um as we speak and then wonders of the world it would be important to know how I can influence the three fact factors for the run of the P Noe well how much storage you provide it's easy how you can how you can influence that right you know buy more drives and put them into your P Noe or you know buy a larger um uh VPS that has more storage so that's easy and the performance score yeah you know have have your have your node run um 24/7 right don't run it on an internet connection in your home when that is bad cuz home internet connections usually become bad on Saturday evenings when everyone's watching movies and then suddenly your internet goes slow that will hit your performance score right and um and you know don't try to cheat always upgrade to the latest version have a good Reaction Time upgrade to the latest version within 24 hours or something that all gives you extra performance points right and then the Stak that you have I also mentioned that how you can influence that right make yourself known right be someone on Discord and on X because you know other other people will see it they will stake stake theirs and with you then because they know you and they know you're running um a performing P Noe so and you know in the beginning with the community being so slow it's so easy to make yourself a name try making yourself a name now on salana it is crazy right because there's lots of competition and people already have millions of soul in stake and um yeah that's how you influence those three factors so it it's really you who influences that and um and yeah yeah you know if you keep complaining about how bad xandum is in public nobody will stake with you right so that's how it is all right um Ste um can I meet you in Dubai at token 2049 uh you know likely know I was traveling a bit here I was excited about Mountain Dow in Salt Lake City so I went up there uh stayed there for like 3 weeks but it wasn't as great as I thought and 2025 is the year of building for xandum uh and that is like the super most important thing and it is also important to make connections and be there and and everything but you know it takes so much time and so much effort and everything that's probably better spent right now to go through all these eras here right so yeah as much as I would have loved to to meet you Steve um I don't think it's going to happen in in in Dubai there is that salana accelerate thing in New York happening in May um I'm a little bit contemplating there because it's specifically for Builders on salana it might be a great idea but also I'm not sure yet because I really need to focus on on on on making our vision a reality here right and this year is the year of of making xandum a reality so likely no story uh but you know if you want to meet me or something we can schedule a a zoom call or Google meet call anytime okay uh wonders of the world so I become visible as the operator of a p note on a platform and the assignment of the staking is automatic no wonders of the world I said it now three times right there is no a platform right there is Discord there is X where everyone hangs out that's interested in the zium project and no it's not automatic everyone decides by themselves where they stay their Zan that's how the world works and that's how salana works and that's how ethereum works and that that's how everything works okay so rri can I swap Zan C from one wallet and then convert to xan and Save in a different wallet um in salana once you have tokens in one wallet you can always transfer them to any other wallet right it's called a transfer so yes can do that um then in an upcoming project no need to complain okay then wonders of the world it is simply difficult to imagine people staking out their own PE noes zand but time will tell yeah so of course other P Noe operators they might not stake to you they stake it to their own P Noe right that's what's happening with salana validators also everyone who runs a validator Stakes all their soul to their own validator but you know there's other people that um that don't run a peoe right or they only run a small PE Noe and then uh the the large PE Noe might just earn them way more staking rewards so they stake it with the larger one um it might also be that uh the xandum foundation um will just offer stake to PES right that's how it works with uh with salana as well right Solana foundation and they offer stake to validators up to 130,000 s can you believe that 130,000 soul that is like what over 10 million 15 million uh 20 million do right you get it just like that boom from from salana Foundation right and we have the xandum foundation they might give you stake H according to criteria and you know the saana foundation has criteria on why they give you steak and for what and they keep changing it right there's nothing like this is the rules and you know five years later you come back and say you said these were the rules no rules are always changing right but they are reasonable right you can trust that the salana foundation as well as the xandum foundation wants to further the the goals of of the xandum network right there will not be like okay xandum Foundation is staking to this guy because he has a cool hairstyle right no they will be staking what gives the maximum value um to to the ecosystem right so you you might expect Stakes even high steak in the beginning most of the steak from the xandum foundation but there are a lot of guys that have a lot a lot a lot of zand right not even inside just people that bought a lot of nodes back in the day and they just you know they they just have millions and millions of Zen and they might not even run a p right they might be kind of more the investor type of guy and they might spread their Zen to um a set of PE note operators that's how it works right look into other projects look how it was and and you know ask like groc 3 or whatever your favorite l is ask them how how the history was you know how was the history with early salano with early cardano with early um Aptos early SOI and and you know all these type of things figure that out it's like you know if you're there in the early days nobody will it will be very very hard for newcomers to to to to surpass you and it's never as easy as in the beginning to convince people to stake with you and it could be just other people it could be newcomers that want to buy zand on an exchange but don't want to run a PE note and then they want to earn want to earn yield on their Zen so they want to stake it to some Poots right and if you're there on there is not a platform right it's just you're there on X on on Discord on you know I don't know wherever you are or you have a cool website that people find when they Google for stakes and tokens your website might show up that's called search engine optimization you might you might feel like that's your path so you become good on SEO search engine optimization people find you on Google and then stay their sand with you right so that's how it works um but you know I can just tell you if you wait a year um it's going to be tough Ju Ju Just try chatting with all these AIS how it worked on all the other blockchains right I can only tell you that's how it is okay uh that was that question um difficult to imagine people staking out their own P noes Zan and then uh Cornell on devet can we Rite Cornell I see you a lot by the way so thank you for for all of your engagement and um that's awesome and if you keep doing that people will naturally stake with your pee if you want to run one right so undef definite can we run the PE Noe on the same machine where we run the validator that's a very good question [Music] um yeah you probably can but I haven't thought till the end if that is something that we want in the long run um but yeah I think I I think you can but we don't have docks for that right so you need to figure out how do you run those two and they won't interfere with each other and stuff like that um you need to figure out the security and all these things um yeah so we don't you know we don't provide support with that right so because many things might go wrong and and you need to figure it out yourself right again running your nodes is your business it's not ours right it's not xandum or xandum foundations so your rewards will be proportional to the fruits of your own work right and um you can I wouldn't probably wouldn't recommend it to run both on the same machine and it might be even prohibited at a later point in time for some reason I but I don't know may maybe maybe it's fine with us um but again I wouldn't really recommend it um um so then we have bjit will the launch of P Noe be after airdrop now we already had the airdrop one right and um the launch of the P note is coming now and then at some point uh later when we launched the Munich release hopefully second half of April or something but you never know it might be May or so um then we launched the Munich release and then immediately after the Munich release it's going to be a great point a great point in time for the adrop too um and um then Cornell again is the P Noe running on devet uh incentivized yes it's incentivized so there will be some amount of of zand per month um that will be paid out just per P Noe um it's going to be locked zand 12 months locked zand as we had it before um with the devad validator noes so it's for the for the first few releases it's going to be very similar to um the validators right there will be that that incentivization and yeah we need to communicate that we need to decide on uh on an amount there and um and communicate it out yeah you know the reward will be to um to obviously pay for your instance right if it's like $550 a month um and and and you operate all this thing of course you should be above this this hosting cost and um hopefully someone more right um yeah and um but I think the real reward is again um putting you in that poll position for main right that's that's what it's all about right it's not like you buy a Peno to get these few bucks a month on on the incentivized death net or you know if you really want and you're like a tech Enthusiast or so yeah that could be the reason but the real reason is you want to have that pole position in mainnet and as I mentioned we're launching into mainnet sooner than we originally thought that I think is great news in itself and I'm excited about it and you know bringing that Wikipedia alternative or that guessing game that we talked about and that's described in the green paper so for all of you that haven't read our green paper yet go to greenp paper. zm. network and um and read up on that one so bjit I hope I pronounced that um correctly if we use VPS can I use my spare one terabyte hard drive if you use the VPS you use the storage of the VPS right so the one that we found out is with a um company called contabo um as far as I know they're headquartered out of Munich Germany so that would be a nice coincidence with the Munich release um they offer that instance for $550 a month and they have either one uh um what is that no they either have 100 GB of nvme or they have 400 GB of normal SATA SSD so we recommend the 400 GB configuration that way you can provide more uh storage to the uh to the network and um yeah if you use the VPS it will be the VPS storage that you that you uh dedicate right if you want to use your drive that you have at home well then it would have to be a home um computer that you use for that and then the credit critical Factor might be the internet connection in devet that will be fine if you have like a nice internet at home and you have like at least two three megabits per second in upload speed and and and an even faster download speed um you should be fine um but yeah if your if your home internet like is offline for an hour or so which happens often right then then you might lose out on some rewards and stuff like that and in the end you know we want to have a reliable and fast storage layer right so we would all need to have a very good internet connection and data centers are doing great on that right they have like you know Diesel power generators and they have several redundant internet connections and all these type of things right so normally you can't beat them and since we don't need like huge amounts of ram in our P noes or or or hug huge amounts of CPU as it is with Salon validator noes they need lots of RAM and they need lots of CPU so they are super super expensive with the p noes all we need is some storage and and a great internet connection right so it is way way cheaper and you can run them from home but probably if I would run it from home I mean for devet it doesn't really matter right but once you're in main net you you know it's your business somehow right I would then at least have two internet providers at home as I have I have Cox via cable here and I also have starlink uh up here actually um um uh on my roof here um so I could I I have a backup right okay uh would you upgrade from web 3 to web five yeah that's a great question I haven't heard of web five uh may maybe maybe it's a hoax question may maybe it's a Sirus question I don't know I just don't happen to have heard of web five um then Michael hey Bernie is it possible to transfer a Pino to a different wallet of the same or another person huh um to transfer a Pino to a different wallet trans so you mean you buy a p Noe and then I I I don't think so in the way that we've programmed it now so you have one wallet which is the manager wallet of the um the manager wallet of the of those P notes right and one manager wallet that pays the the zand fees that are uh necessary for for that it can manage up to 3 p noes as of now at least and [Music] um yeah and that is the manager wallet right so transfer yeah what what is transfer actually right so you can always close your P note right you get um any stake that is there you will then get that back and um you will get your whatever the the the the storage fees on salana you will get them back a little bit and um then you can use your manager wallet and and create a new P Noe something like that but I don't know I haven't thought about these details and honestly you know things are complicated on a technical basis every little feature that you feel oh it's just a little feature it's going to set us back for weeks and weeks with building the storage layer right so I don't see that really as a priority or are you I I I don't know I mean it's like you have your wallet you buy up to three p notes and that's it for now and we go through through all these um um all these arrows here so yeah um then be cret again will it be Dev to main net directly or will they be a test net in between so most likely we'll have that Dev net and then we'll go to main net straight at some point as early as we can in um I believe the mine era when when we're going to be when we have that mvp and and we'll be able to support early daps on Main net right so that will go very fast um so we will go from devet to mainnet directly at at least that's the current plan right I mean don't tell me like I have so many people Bernie you said this like seven months ago right things change guys right if you ask me questions I can only give you the the the the opinion and the thoughts that I have right now so uh don't kill me if things change right but um we're thinking of going to to main net directly in in uh the in the M era and uh supporting our own apps and hopefully even other apps if one of you guys have ideas on what you want to build as as a decentralized app that uses a storage layer you know you can go live on mainnet um you know in in our M era in you know the the middle of the year in the in the summer early summer I hope so um and uh and then the test net probably after that the main net the dev net will kind of morph into a test net so we need to have more and more nodes on test net and the same number of nodes that we have on Main net but that all depends on you know what will be the storage Demand on Main net actually and how many um how many P noes do we need it's all a supply and demand Market driven um economy and you know there's no way I can make any announcements here like you know the Zan prize is going to be this in 6 months or we need uh you know so many devet nodes in seven months it it all depends on the adoption right how many developers will there be that actually build their apps on xandum and are these successful developers right will they really get users onto their decentralized apps that's the key factor right um if that happens you know it it can explode really really quick then in a short period of time we need tons of new P noes in order to cater to that exploding demand and then we also need these number of nodes in our test net right so at some point like late summer or something probably the dev net will just be renamed to to test net so if you have bought a a devet node that will automatically grandfather you in to run it on testnet the testet is usually even more incentivized right because the test net we have to rely on the test net to have as many nodes as we have in main net we need to rely on the test net to be you know super super quick to be updated to any new versions We have to rely on the test net to be just as performant as the main net it it's kind of a reference environment where if we have new versions We want to test them on a test net that's close as close as possible to main net circumstances right so yeah that's that's likely how it's going to play out mainnet quite early in addition to devet then we have devet then we have devet and mainnet running in in parallel and then after that the devet will kind of morph into to a test net and then likely there will be a new devet which will just be like 10 nodes or so um operated by by a few other guys and and maybe some of them by xandum Foundation um operated by xandum Foundation themselves and um providing that devet so then it will be like similar to what we see right now on salana right the dev net is just 10 nodes or so and and the test net has the same number of nodes as we have on Main net right and what you do now in devnet when you start running a p note on devet it'll automatically transition over to test net right okay uh okay test net between Wonders of the World already answered that and Bam all right I love that name was absolutely spoton um but you can call me bam also all right um Michael so every release in a new era means to update our administrative tasks for a storage provider or panote owner yeah probably there will be minor releases even in between that right so we have like uh constant fryberg and Munich those are kind of larger milestones in between that there might be many many more releases right and on devet you don't need to do each and every upgrade because we have also a tret a tret is three validator nodes and then maybe like 10 or 20 P noes and we operate that on our own we can control it completely and probably there we do like many software updates per day even right or at least many per week and we don't want to do that with the devet operators right so we have our own tret that we use in development and then at some point once we have it you know somewhat stable we put it into the devet but it's not like those are the only releases right there's not like constants and then fryberg and then Munich right after fryberg there might be three or four intermediate releases or five or six before we come to Munich cuz Munich is quite a major Milestone it's the complete working prototype so yeah that's how it works and we don't know yet how often we we want um software updates from you uh we recently updated the the validator software that That's the basis on devet for the P Note software and this all needs to be compatible with each other right so we have the devet validators they are running on 2.1.4 now they need to update to 2.2.0 which we just released or are about to release right to be compatible with the pnot software right so these all need to work together and um yeah um will we get a step by step how to description like we had in the past yeah obviously uh th those are the docs they're ready we just need to uh publish them uh and then and Bam again can we use Ledger wallet to buy the P noes yes you can we need to test that that's a good point um but of course you can um but if not you know just transfer them the 35,000 and out of your Ledger transfer it to some other wallet and use that one right because you can use any wallet um because uh yeah you you uh the the the VIP thing is tied to your email address not to a wallet address so as long as you enter your your code the VIP code that will be emailed out um you can use any wallet uh to buy that right so um I'd probably just transfer it out of The Ledger wallet and then buy it with with a hot wallet it's just easier right and 35,000 zand is not an amount that you need to have high security for okay um next one quote what is that quation for life um please make a video about withdrawal process okay what withdrawal process uh do you mean there um yeah so it seems like we have quite a number of concurrent users here now um also on X and we got a little bit confused I actually wanted to do this amaama as an X bases so that it's just more interactive and and we can hear your guys's voice and stuff like that um somehow my team misunderstood me so now it's a now it's a YouTube here um which is fine as well and it's streaming in parallel so I have that that new uh software here that streams it in parallel at the same time to both YouTube and X right so you don't have to watch on YouTube you can watch it on X directly right now as I see it here we even have more parallel Watchers on on X than we have on on YouTube which is nice and um yeah this was my AMA and [Music] um the the the the thing is um I might do an X spaces as well at some point um next week uh so maybe yeah I don't know let's announce it and let's have an xace cuz I'd love to hear your voices and really discuss things with you right this is this is not so interactive here with uh with the chat right so um and and I'm I I'm I don't think the guys on watching on X right now they actually see the questions that are being typed on YouTube um but I'm reading them for that P purpose right I'm not even sure if people are asking questions on X right now uh via DMS or something maybe you can look uh into it and um yeah so wonders of the world thank you Bernie uh brr also can we move the P noes running in local machines to VPS or will we have to buy a separate one if we want to transfer the the node um yeah again also I don't know that's a that's a good point uh a good good uh thing to think about um yeah I don't know it would be nice if you could do that but it might be tough to to put it all into software here on our end so um oh yeah by the way uh look at that if you for the ones that are listening on on X right now you can just send me a DM and then it'll appear is it a chat okay there's a chat in X okay so when you watch this uh live video on on X there's a chat function there so and that will show up here in my on my monitor here as merged right so I see both when people ask questions on YouTube but I will also see um if someone's chatting uh chatting me up on um on X so that's good to know uh for the future um yeah but I think for now it was an hour uh it was fun uh thanks for all the engagement and um yeah catch you guys later and and let me know if that would be cool to have an X spaces where you know I can actually pull you guys I mean you can request the mic you can reest to be a speaker and then I can I can approve that and then we can just talk right and and talk things through that makes it sometimes so much easier right I'll just see a quick question and then I have a long answer and then sometimes people just say like oh I meant it this and that way so um yeah that's how it works um for today though um don't forget to smash that like button um because it helps the YouTube algorithm so much and and uh leave me a comment uh use the chat function on X as well leave us some some comments on this video some replies on this video on X and all of these things um will give you points on points. z. network but for today I'm I'm really excited about um all this engagement as always and think it was great having done that I feel like there's a few questions that are really really important I understand you're asking these questions um but where I just didn't didn't have an answer for uh we'll look into that U but bear with me if we don't Focus that much on these type of things we really really focus on on building the actual storage layer getting that that release out and getting the oh mayor thank you yeah it works on X awesome awesome um so we'll we'll advertise that next time also and we really really want to focus on building that storage layer and not so much on side functionality if someone has bought and then they want to move it there and they want to use another wallet it's like yeah I understand all that and it would be so cool but you know it's just we we we need to focus and it sounds so easy but it's often so difficult to implement and it's like a special case for like two people that actually want that um so bear with me you know if it's easy in some points we'll take all your input that we got today and and are building that um um but you know we we can't do it any we can't do it in any case yeah it's expensive that's correct so yeah I'm in I'm in talking mood right now so if you have any more questions um uh feel free to ask it but otherwise I think I think um this has been uh over an hour it's been it's been a great session um thanks again don't forget to smash that like button here we go and um catch you guys next time bye
