TITLE: Ep 325: We launched the XAND token! Here's what happened...
================================================================================

yeah hey hey hey guys we did it I launched the token I launched the xan token and I couldn't have done it without all you guys and all the team that was working in the background and I'll tell you that was an amount of work the last few months the last few weeks and especially the last two days and launching something on an exchange whether it's a token or whether it's a stock somewhere it is a huge Adventure that's what I'm telling you and you know guys it is it it you know it was such an amount of work and it's such a big day in my life right and we've successfully launched the token and I can tell you I cannot tell you all the details right but over the last three days I had at Le at least like six different situations six different moments six different periods of like ranging from 30 minutes to like 3 hours or so where I thought like okay we can't do it no we we we we we can't launch it we have to we have to push the date we have to whatever right it was can you imagine that I mean it is such a big day and um thank you everyone thank you all early community that was with us you know in the early days we were Boku we had the oku token we renamed it all into xandum we had the xan token that then became the xandum classic token and now we have that xan token with the brand new architecture that's 100% salana based we're building a scalable storage layer for Sal we have our road map online um the next Milestones are all in the Pipeline with building our stuffff with growing the community with marketing with everything and yeah it's so exciting and you know after this big milestone the Temptation is to kind of recognize and acknowledge that the work is just starting right the work is just starting this is not a milestone to go frolicking somewhere on the beach for uh for few weeks or something it is just starting and now in addition to building everything we have to maintain the token price and figure out what drives the token price and do a lot of marketing and that all in addition um to building our product but that's how it always is and even if you know some projects take the other way and the other route and they say okay we do everything with Venture Capital still you'd have to always always be raising right that's the that's the key word in Silicon Valley AB always be raising right and um whether it's through an exchange or whether if if it's with VCS and everything but man everything worked out last minute I mean there are a few things that take a little bit of time right and it's not like you know we've just launched 3 hours ago 9:00 a.m. so 4 hours ago right 9:00 a.m. was the launch now it's 1:00 p.m. here in uh in in the Pacific time zone and yeah this is how the token looks like on uh on Mexi right so you see the price movement here the trend is upwards as we see we're at 2 point uh what is that two 2.75 cents here right now um so yeah let's let's check how much that is right in fully diluted uh valuation here somewhere um yeah me get my calculator out here so 0275 Time 4 bli 51 million that is a 110 million dollar fully diluted valuation and man guys that is a value of $10 million that we've created over the past two two and a half years it wouldn't have been possible without our community you guys are the best community in the world and I keep repeating that until I die and if you like videos like that give me that thumbs up um comment to my video and what we've seen with the launch on Mexi um there is not a crazy amount of sell pressure right I mean the price went down the initial price was as you can see that in the in the candles on Mexi um initial listing price was 7.5 cents and went down to like 2 and a half right now and um that's kind of normal with many launches where you know where we have air drops we had a huge airdrop and kind of the the upgrade from old zansi token I consider that type of an airdrop as well it's just two types of recipients that that um came about their tokens on on different paths but somehow um we we distribute these tokens to um to a community and um there is not that much of a selling pressure we have maybe like uh yeah so for the day if I go for for one day here on Mexi and let's see what the uh the volume was it was 3.5 million but that must be Zen right not uh not dollars don't even know how I can see the dollar amount here um but it was just like 60 60 70,000 or so um that were traded in the first few hours Mexi is mostly located in Asia the whole team is in Asia our Market maker is in Europe and in Asia so it's night there right now we can't really reach them there are a few things with the dexes the decentralized exchanges there's hardly any liquidity in these pools yet um we can't reach our market makers right now so it'll take until tomorrow or so until we have some liquidity in these pools because there is so little liquidity the price is way way lower um on on these dexes so that's why on Jupiter it seems like a way lower price than we have here on Mexi um but remember you know the the significant volume trading volume as of now is on Mexi not on the dexas because um the market maker hasn't put that much liquidity into the dexas um anyone can though right if you want to um create your own trading pool for whatever zand usdc zand Sol or something like that um you can do that on radium on Orca on on Meteora where wherever you want to do that um and do that right but for now it's just man we've launched that token Against All Odds and um a and we don't have crazy selling pressure here despite the fact that you know there are a lot of people that that that made a lot of points on the points app and some of them might not really know what what xandum is doing they might not know about the long-term potential of a scalable storage layer um they might not know about our road map and the P noes that we'll be launching and all these type of things so given that fact I feel we have very little selling pressure here um and um let's see how the price develops right and um I'm happy we did all that I'm happy um um you you know you guys were there and were so supportive and received a ton of support this morning on our Discord server and you know everyone everyone was happy for all of that and um yeah the work is just starting and yeah I can tell you it's one of the last Adventures here um super happy uh this all worked out and and it's the beginning of a story of uh of you know a brand new chapter in the in the history of xandum and now it's all out in the public and and we have a we have a token price it'll show on coin market cap and on on coin gecko soon so Mexi is doing that for us and again you know they are in the middle of the night now so there's a few things I'm not happy about with with these guys and yeah you learn as you go um and and um yeah but otherwise um you know we did it so and we have this other thing we have the liquid staking the storage enable liquid staking and let me uh get back to you here and by the way this is um uh this is just a a remote login here to um to the Mexi account of um of a friend outside of the US that has that account and then um for the liquid staking um let's look at this here let's connect a wallet this is zam's uh liquid staking app and um you see that here in this wallet I just have very little um Sol amount and by the way when you click Max it won't spend all your soul right it always leaves a little bit of Sal in your wallet because you you know never leave the house without s in your pocket right you need it for transactions um and it and it'll never you know drain all of your Sal out of your wallet for for liquid staking and uh you see that projected yield here because we're sharing block rewards we're sharing me rewards and by the way on salana Compass you see this projected yield here also while this is likely only in this one Epoch um the epoch will change so we're not like a pool that just with the normal rewards is at this high of an apy but we believe it will still be uh very very high this is like kind of the initial phase once it's kind of um knows everything and and and is in some Epoch um then then this will go down to like maybe something 8.5 9 10% or so it'll still be super high because we're remember we're the first liquid staking pool that's sharing block rewards programmatically right there's no other liquid staking pool when I say pool I mean multiv validator right because that's what that's why you want to go for a pool you don't want to monitor individual validators right and um and by the way all the future storage rewards once a storage layer goes live it all goes into that liquid staking pool as well so you have these four here three of them are live right now and the number four will go live when the storage layer goes live but then we have number five down here the boosted yield right and right now we have a 10x current boost and this number here takes into account the um the current uh price of the xan token so it's about 12% more here right so next Epoch likely this will go to like 9% but then 12 more then you will have 21% here as the boosted yield on your soul uh which is uh just awesome and then we will show you here soon and the devs are working on that um we will show you how much Sal is in the pool right now and what is the what is the tvl the total value locked uh measured in dollars right so right now we're still in that hyperdrive uh phase here um hyperdrive stage 10x boost right right that's fantastic and you're getting a crazy amount of Zan for free just for staking with us um in in the very first day when the pool volume is still below 30,000 so right and at 30,000 so it'll go from hyperdrive to the Launchpad stage to the Forex right so let's check out where we are this is the address here of our liquid staking pool and um let's refresh this now to see where we are has a refresh now it is so we're at like 13,000 so that's 2374 million of tvl Just 4 hours after launch so thank you everyone uh for staking with us and yeah it seems like we will be reaching the uh the 30,000 so uh threshold uh real soon and then moving onwards to the Launchpad stage to um to the other stages there so the liquid staking is also a great great uh feature of the whole zandian platform all right I'll make it short today guys you know I want to celebrate a little bit um unfortunately you know most of our team is distributed so we can't really do it I sometimes miss the old days when we were all in an office and could just say okay let's go out and and let's celebrate a little bit um yeah but you know I'm I'm going to do that here I'm I'm glad we we reached this Milestone and even though it's just the beginning of a lot and lot a lot more hard work right it is still a nice Milestone and we need to celebrate what we've achieved rather than you know only seeing it as as a means as a stepping stone to Something in the future we need live in the in the present and in the present moment and uh and celebrate what we have and I think this is a major major Milestone um it is the first time in my life I have anything listed whether it's a stock or a fund or a token in this case it's a token and um I couldn't be happier with that and and and I couldn't be more proud and uh more happy with you know working on this important problem here which is you know adding that scalable storage layer to present day uh blockchains yeah so thanks everyone for uh you know having having joined us and having supported us by the way almost 70% of all the the tokens that were freely available right so the circulating Supply right now is about 600 million tokens but only 205 of that went to people the airdrop recipients and the xandum classic recipients right the rest is like Foundation funds that we want to sell over time in order to fund the further development of the of the storage layer um it is going to be used for marketing and all these type of things right so these are kind of controlled by Foundation by you know someone from from from from from the team um but but the wallets that are for you guys and for the community um that's 205 million um available today so so a total of 410 but you know 50% were claimable um on day one so that's 205 and out of that 25 um some of them some of that was unclaimed like 18 million or so was unclaimed so we had like 170 or so that would would have been um available and over 120 123 or so were staked with our stake zand offering right I would have never thought this a product would be so successful um 68% of the circulating zand was put into that staking contract right 68% that's almost 70% um put it in there and locked it up for 42 days which is just awesome and um yeah so we will see after 42 days um if we um have an extended offer there and you know keep people staking it and stuff like that and um yeah exciting things so we're we've launched on Mexi we've launched on Jupiter right Jupiter finds the dexus right it seems like there's a pool on Orca that that the market maker has created there seems to be another pool on Meteora but don't worry about that just do it on Jupiter it doesn't cost much it costs minimal um if at all I've never really researched it but I see you know it just gives you the best price and but these pools that the market makers have created there is not much liquidity in there something must have gone wrong but those guys are sleeping all right so we'll see that tomorrow also the listing on coin market cap and coin gecko it can take a few times um until we see it there Mexi is handling that for us um so that they can pull the price directly from from Mexi and um yeah so everything's going the right direction the liquid staking has launched so the Stak all was a huge success I've never thought that almost 70% will take that offer right and um liquid staking huge success already $2.3 million in total value locked in our liquid staking pool can you believe that and um and the launch success right we we we're trading we're live right and and the price movement um is up and the price isn't there yet where I want to see it I'll be honest with you right I would would have wanted to see the price in very different areas and we'll discuss with the market makers what are the reasons for that um for everyone that's interested in buying some xan tokens I can only say it's a great great opportunity now right you cannot buy a lot for these low prices right it's especially an opportunity for those of us that just want to invest a 00 right just go to Mexi or go to Jupiter and buy some Zan for a few hundred you know I'm I can't predict anything and no Financial advice here but you know I believe you likely never get it for that same price right and I bought some over the last few hours and um for you know I think I I started I I deposited 8,900 8,900 usdt um into Mexi and I bought some some zand in several tranches and I looked into it um before the video here and it was at 11,200 right that was a 26% gain in just three three and a half hours or so right annualize that and it's like tens of thousands of% right and there's a lot of volatility in there so it's great for Traders I think all the trade in Bots and the Arbitrage Bots and they take a while until they discover all that so I expect first of all the price to stabilize more um with with you know all the all the trading Bots Arbitrage Bots all that stuff and the market making being really in in in in full blossom there and um I really firmly believe likely it's a great great buying opportunity um and yeah let's see how it all develops but for now I mean thank you guys it's a huge milestone I love it and I'll take it as you know your personal um proof of trust against us and the team and me right that we have this market cap here of 110 fully diluted market cap of $10 million and of course you know we will be working as always like crazy 247 um to make this thing happen and to get to all the future Milestones um that that we have on our road map and if you haven't looked into our road map um do it right look look at our on our website and and uh just go to xandum network and and if you go on start here you see the road map here I'm not going to click it for you here right now but there are so many things to learn about what problem are we solving what's the solution what is that Cambrian explosion that I keep talking about it is so important because that's our North Star right that's what we want to do spark the Cambrian explosion for blockchain and AI already had its Cambrian explosion but blockchain hasn't and you know I'm talking with some uh Publications here to do an oped um on that Cambrian explosion and and that'll actually be great the Zan token utility it's one of the most utility Rich tokens out there the achievements we've made so far the road map and then you learn about our vision the storage layer itself the launch timeline um the Zan tokenomics the blockchain storage trilemma that we're solving here the white paper the docks and the the validators right so yeah um so much stuff on here um so glad we made it to this milestone for today uh thanks so much for watching guys catch you later peace
