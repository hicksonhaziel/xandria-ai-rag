TITLE: Ep 407: Time Travel to 11x Your Xandeum Storage Rewards - Titan NFT Sale Live Now!
================================================================================

Hey, hey, hey, hey everyone. Blockchain Bernie here. Big, big changes are coming up with the Xandium rewards. All right, Xandium, if you don't know, it is the storage layer um for the Salana blockchain fully smart contract native exabytes for the Salana smart contracts. And you know, [clears throat] there have been four reward seasons already and one reward season is one quarter. So 3 months and reward season 4 has just ended and these four reward seasons they have been kind of automatic right. So the Xandium Foundation has prepared all these um all these rewards and they have been paid out by the DAO. But now Zandium is at a stage where they hand over the full responsibility for all the rewards payment where it belongs to the DAO itself [snorts] and the DAO was governed by the Xand token holders. Xand is X A N D. So that's the token. If you don't own Xand um you can buy it on Jupiter jup.ag ag um buy your ZAN token to you know help govern the Xandium network which is the storage layer right so and um now Xandium Foundation is handing that all over to the DAO which means there will be a DAO proposal likely prepared by Xandium Foundation for a reward season 5 but reward season 5 will happen under the terms of the DAO right, the Zan token holders where it belongs. And now let me tell you a little bit about all the different rewards that are possible on uh on the Xandium network. So let's go here to zandium.network, which is their main website. And [clears throat] then here's that earn um button, right? And here's rewards overview. And you see there are so many different rewards here. So you can earn rewards like crazy. And um if you click on that rewards overview, you see these things here. Uh it still says current rewards season 3, but you know that is changing quickly. Um we're in season 4. Season 4 or has already ended. And then one liquid stake soul for Zansol, right? And then you can earn Xand rewards for that. These will be paid out for reward season 3 really really soon. Then you can stake ZAM tokens in the DAO. You get 16% APY. Reward season 4 has just ended. So you can claim these. Then you can provide liquidity. You get Zand extra Xand rewards in addition to the trading fees also for that. Number four is own Xand and unlock governance power. Um, reward possibility five is earn points. Show your support. Go to points.zandium.network. Points.zandmium.network. There you can collect your points. For example, as easy as liking this video. So, if you haven't liked it already, that's all I'm asking. You know, destroy that like button. It helps the channel a lot. It helps Sandium a lot. Also, leave me a comment there for both. You can collect your points on the points network. All right. So, then number six. Oh, that's Wait, wait, wait. Then number six, run a Zandium validator. You can earn rewards for that also. Run a Zandium P node. You can earn rewards, but you can also earn the storage income. So, this guy, this here guys is the real deal, right? That is the real deal. how you can earn the big big rewards later on when the storage layer goes live and will collect all those storage fees from those apps. You'll earn that that storage income. So running a Zandium P node is the biggest thing you can do here in in the Xandium network and you can upgrade your old the Xandium classic to the Xan token. So that's eight different possibilities here. Um, so I think I lost you here. So we had that earn points, run a Zandium validator, run a Zandium P node. So that's again the biggest thing you can do. And then upgrade Zanc to Xan. So so many possibilities here to earn your rewards. Most of these rewards have been going in seasons. So you have been able to claim these rewards as the seasons end. Um we're now at the end of season 4. Um that's one year and um and Zandium uh foundation is now handing everything over to the DAO. That's a big step to decentralization of governance. The storage layer itself is totally decentralized. Anyway, we have those XandMP nodes that um are the network. The Xandium Podes is comprises the Xandium storage layer and um and all these all these P nodes and now Xandium Foundation is handing over complete control to the DAO. So if you want to become part of that you need to own your ZAN tokens. So buy your ZAN tokens on Jupiter. The link is down in the description. It's also on the website zandium.network. There's a big link on how you can buy your Zen tokens. You can vote in the DAO. You can basically vote for your own rewards. How does that sound? Right. So, and of course, it has a disadvantage. If you give out all the tokens in the DAO, that should be there in order to foster the community, right? To to um to reward grants for app builders for building the first apps and all that kind of stuff. um if if you pay out too much out of the XAN and just for all the XAN holders to to get even more Xan, then um you know that that that would not be beneficial to the community and to the Xan prize in the long term. So, I'm really looking forward to the discussion that we're going to have um inside the DAO. And if you don't know, DAO means um decentralized autonomous organization. So it's basically like like a big club of these token holders and they can govern the the whole network and make all these decisions and Xandium is making that big step in completely handing it over not having these council votes anymore where just the council of the of the DAO makes the decisions but it's all going to be community votes. So, it's all going to be you, the Zand token holders that uh make that uh make that decision. All right. So, that was my quick video today. Uh if you have any questions, um leave me a comment. I'll answer many of them uh personally as much as I can. And um don't forget to like and subscribe to uh leave a comment and for today. Thanks so much for watching, guys. Catch you later. Peace.
