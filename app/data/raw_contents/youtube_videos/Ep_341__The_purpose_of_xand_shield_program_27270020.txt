TITLE: Ep 341: The purpose of xand-shield-program
================================================================================

we're here with Bernie and Sean from xandum and I want to talk nodes because man so many crazy wonderful opportunities in web 3 when it comes to running our own n and really supplying the tech that we need to get to the next level when it comes to web 3 Bernie thank you so much for taking the time let's go over this whole thing cuz PE noes are all the buzz they're right around the corner please tell me what are they yeah Pinos are are uh the thing now and uh I I'm glad Sean came up with they sound like peanuts right so sometimes we use that as a as a visualization there those P noes are the provider nodes of the xandum storage layer we need that xandum storage layer to make real decentralized apps and we need to get it off the validator nodes right that's the reason storage doesn't scale right with salana right now it's all in in any other smart contract chain all the accounts are stored on those validator nodes and that means we always have a high redundancy of 3,000 because we have 3,000 validators right every piece of data is stored on 3,000 validators so we have these provider nodes they provide the storage they are the core of that storage layer they will be the they will be the core of web 3 those are smaller nodes right it is not like a Geeks thing right they don't need a lot of memory they don't need a lot of CPU they only need storage as the more storage the better you provide it to the zum Network and it needs a good good internet connection and fast and reliable internet connection that's all it takes and they are super easy to manage we have that graphical user interface called zand minor and these are the core of the network 94% of all fees that are being generated later on when we're on mainnet will go to these P noes they decide how much they move they pass on to their stakers how much they pass on to the validators that send them these challenges to make sure that everything works smoothly yeah so and that's that's you know let me because I'm a big fan of always start with why right why do we even need those PE notes yeah in order to get that redundancy down to make the thing scalable because AED tendy of 3,000 for everything is not a good thing right and the app should decide right some apps say like well I'm fine if I have it on there three p noes other say on seven others say on 43 and um and that's why we need these P noes and it's a big big community in you know if everything works and we're storing exabytes or even uh zettabytes of storage someday we will have millions of penos and and that's all stage of course in the Deep South era which is the first era of our development there will be 300 PES and um super excited 299 I'm running one you got it okay so and and that's why we need those pinotes they're going to be the core of almost every each and every web 3 app that's out there because what is web3 without a storage layer we believe and that's what we're building it for at least that each and every web 3 app that's out there will utilize that storage layer just because it's there why would you not use it right and and the P noes are the core of that now I understand that we don't want 3,000 redundancies of one file that makes sense for validators is there any other reasons why not just leverage the existing validators to deploy these Fe noes yeah it it it's just it's just that reason right that that with the current architecture of smart contract chains and that's not only true for it's it's true for all smart contract chains um the only place you can store data between transactions persistently is in these accounts model and and the accounts are on each and every validator they have to be there they have to be super super fast because we don't want to hold up the blockchain right it's like 2,000 payload transaction on salana for each and every second so the validators need to keep them in Ram they can't even afford afford to have them on on their disc right the valid a is just a normal computer so it does have a dis but if they're not in Ram they will just be too slow to keep up with with the blockchain that's why the requirements are so high for those validators right yeah yeah yeah absolutely the requirements are quite High and um and you know that's by Ram in a normal computer random access memory or just memory it can scale with regards to capacity that much because it's like super super fast we have these dams and ddr4 ddr5 ddr6 so that is technology that just costs some money and is only scalable to a certain amount I mean today you can have a terabyte of ram in a very expensive server environment or a few terabytes but you know you you can't have like a 100 terabytes or something right in in a normal computer and it's temporary right once you flip that switch off it's gone oh yeah absolutely yeah yeah also that and you know there's a lot of successful web two apps that literally need pedabytes of storage right which is a th000 terabytes is a petabyte right so we need to store all that and we can't have it with that redundancy we can't we can't even have it with that speed right discs are always slightly slower they can be super fast also right and it's going to be of course all SSD based and likely the requirement is going to be the latest nvme in in mainnet once we go mainnet because there's also a competition between P noes right I mean they need to have their performance score and their reliability score and all that type of thing um so it's still going to be fast but as in real life the normal disc that you have on your MacBook is not as fast as the ram right it's just a slightly little bit slower and that's how it's going to be with our with the xandum storage layer as well and we need these these P noes these specialized nodes because not having them that was the reason storage doesn't scale today yeah now Sean when it comes to the community aspect of things because if you're going to run nodes if you're going to get you know anyone to run these things it's not a a one person deal like it this is a lot of people coming together and saying yeah we believe we believe in this and we're going to get behind it what's been the response for the community at xandum are these people excited to run nodes um do you foresee you know those 300 nodes going out rather quickly because of the number of people that are already excited about xandum yeah I think we don't have enough P noes in this era to keep up with the demand to be honest with you you know the community is super excited and the community is wants to get their hands on these and they want to run them honestly and in this era we're only deploying a very small amount 300 actually 299 as action was saying but um those are going to go by quick and we are limiting them to a few nodes per wallet however we really want to diversify who has them we want you guys to have them we don't want one or two or three or a couple people having a bunch we want we want it spread out amongst the community that's a big deal to us and you know like I said before in the other videos just to reiterate without the community we are we need you just as much as you know you need us now talk to me about costs why does it have such a big impact on costs when you're having individuals like myself run these NS as opposed to having larger infrastructures like your aws's and your Google clouds of the world yeah I mean first of all bringing the redundancy down from 3,000 to let's say three that's already 1,000x in cost right number one then having uh lower Hardware requirements that's probably another 10x then we're at 10,000x in cost um and um yeah so that that's the thing right and and of course the higher redundancy an app wants the the more expensive it gets right and um so the nod just a matter of putting the power back in the hands of the people allowing them to select what it is that they actually want if they want reny 40 times over let them have it it's just they're going to pay uh an increased price and in comparison somebody that doesn't want as much redundancy for these notes yeah absolutely got it okay so when it comes to the the pricing model um I love the fact that you're actually enabling the community to be able to earn like you mentioned 94% that's a huge amount um of the the fees actually going back to these nodes um where do we go from here is this sustainable um are we going to be able to keep this going why go to the Community First why not build it yourself yeah so great question so um it's all it's all going to be you know Community Driven it's all super decentralized and we have all all these errors that I talked about with those six errors and somewhere at you know era three or four which will be the um the the coal era we are building those fee markets so that supply and demand always is balancing right so we had a lot of discussions like like why don't we just dictate as we as sandium or xandum Foundation or the da just dictates how much the storage is that won't work because demand will Spike and it'll come in waves right and then there's a new W new app that's going to be um adopted like crazy and then and then storage prices will go up for a while until there's more P noes that can actually deliver all that storage and and it has has to be a market driven fee model otherwise you know supply and demand is going to go wild right and we need to always balance it right and um and that raises another question like if someone's using the zum storage layer from Mission critical apps or stuff they need to have some predictability on how much it costs right so for that there I Envision there will be middlemen that just sell you kind of a Futures Contract or something right and it's like okay you can store one pyte of data for the next six months or for the next three years on xandum for this and that price got it so they add their kind of insurance premium there so that they give you predictability right you very yeah so you can do the same thing with like 10year treasury notes which are yeah they are different from you know varying you know daily varying right so yeah I mean that Open Market opens up a lot of opportunity not only for people to earn but also for the word of zum to get spread out there because let me tell you when I run a node I tell everybody about it right so this community aspect of it is really really cool absolutely yeah what are you guys envisioning um coming next I know that we need these nodes um are we talking about getting them set up in a specific country do you want to go all over the world and why do we need it to go everywhere yeah of course if we want that that Cambrian explosion to happen and have all these different apps that that use the storage layer they need to be everywhere we will have regions uh that's part of the um the coal era as well where we introduce regions and have different fee models for different uh regions it's it's legal reasons of course right there's there's a reason why Amazon did that on AWS right um so we're going to have all these regions we're going to have um encryption layers and you know some some apps even need to be hippoc compliant or stuff like that so those are all going to be optional layers on top of that um that we can use to to do that um but right now I mean the launch of the P noes in general the very first P noes will become available really really soon on March 25th awesome so and that's the first 300 and we limit it to that 300 in the first era just because there's also a cost associated with it right it's like it's a hardware that needs to be paid and and is running in our devet so there will there won't be fees coming in that cover it as we've later have in in mainnet in mainnet it's all permissionless but in in devet um you will have to to pay a small protective fee it's G to be 35,000 zand which is as of today less than $100 and and it's really like a protective fee um but we want to keep you know and then we'll pay a monthly um a monthly fee for running these in our devet because there's no real fees coming out because they we're not on Main net yet um so that is all a cost Factor right we don't want to have like 10,000 right now we need to do it step by step but then you know very soon once we're at the Frankfurt release we go on mainnet we have real apps we have real real uh Soul coming in in fees for the storage layer that are being distributed so um yeah love it one last question here Sean why have a goey why set it up in a way that you know your grandma can do it well I mean if if we want widespread adoption it needs to be easy whether you're a techie or not we want to do things easier in life there's no need to over complicate there's no need to go on command line and type out some code while that is you know relatively easy for someone advanced in Tech we want it to be easier you know you use anything iPhone computer nowadays it's intuitive you don't even need an instruction booklet to use it that's how we want our software to work yeah Sean you even came up with that slider that we have in in xan minor where you can just you know move the slider and say okay I contribute a terabyte or maybe two terabytes of the storage that I have locally to the zum Network right right it it just has to be user friendly fast I love it well guys thank you so much I appreciate you giving me the why behind it all would love to talk more a little bit when it comes to what this thing actually looks like
