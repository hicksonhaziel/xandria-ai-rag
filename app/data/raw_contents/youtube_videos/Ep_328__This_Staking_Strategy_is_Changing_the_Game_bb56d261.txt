TITLE: Ep 328: This Staking Strategy is Changing the Game 💰
================================================================================

hey hey hey hey I've got a gamechanging staking strategy for you and I bet you haven't heard of it yet it's called L it's called storage enabled liquid staking what the hell is that I'll dive into all the details for you in this little video and I promise you it's a gamechanging staking strategy and I'll tell you all the stories of what staking actually is why you should stake if you're not doing so otherwise you're just leaving money on the table what is native staking what is liquid staking and what is storage enable liquid staking and what do you get back in our case it's going to be Zan Soul so it's the Stak salana token that you're getting back and what can you do with it and how does it work internally and in the end I'll let you know a bonus way of just earning some extra rewards on top of everything so make sure you watch this video all the way to the end and don't forget to smash that like button for me it really helps the YouTube algorithm And subscribe to my Channel all right so let's dive right into it here um we have storage enabled liquid staking here and as you all know this channel is mostly about the salana chain so I'm blockchain Bernie here broadcasting live from from fabulous Las Vegas and I you know do General blockchain stuff and crypto stuff but mostly about the salana chain and um with your s tokens that you're buying somewhere on some centralized exchange you get your Sal on binance on coinbase on Kraken on okx on bybit wherever you get your s don't leave it in there withdraw it into your own wallet and take self- custody of your soul because that's what crypto is all about if you leave it with them it's no different than traditional banking right so you want to get it out withdraw it from there put it into your own wallet like a phantom wallet or a suf flare wallet where you can have your um salana in and then you can do storage enable liquid staking so there are two sorts of staking we have the uh the normal regular native staking where you stake to one valid Ator and it's locked for a specific period of time right in salana that is called one Epoch one Epoch is about two to two and a half days it can vary a little bit but your soul is locked up for that period so that means when you unstake you have a coold down period until you can withdraw it back so the cool down takes until the end of the current Epoch so it could be anywhere from almost nothing if you just do that at the end of the epoch until like 2 and a half days if you do it in the beginning of the epoch and then you have bad luck and it's going to be a long Epoch it could be like 2 and a half days so that's how staking works the native staking and it has a few disadvantages right first of all you have that lockup for these two days or so and also you are tied to one validator so you'd have to monitor that validator if the m validator has good performance and usually what you want to do if you just want to get the best return from your Sal tokens is you want to have diversification you want to stake it to a bunch of validators and it doesn't have to be 150 validators or so right some people want to tell you that but that's over diversification right you just want the most performant ones and if it's six or eight or 12 that's enough diversification actually um just keep that in mind so for liquid Stak there are several options out there for you on salana marinade is one jeto is one jeto is cooperating with the Phantom wallet so once you use the Phantom wallet you see jeto and goo and goo everywhere um so yeah but you know we're doing storage Ena liquid staking on xandum right and xandum is that um scalable storage layer for the salana chain that uh xandum Foundation is building and I'm Bernie Bloom I'm the founder and CEO of xandum labs that develops the software for the zum foundation so for all the these extra storage rewards that will be coming out once the storage layer will be completed all these rewards go into that zanol thing so if you see this here storage enable liquid staking rewards we see our total value locked just two or three days after launch about we're already at 5.2 million total value locked that's over 30,000 sold so thank you everyone for trusting us that was a very very fast start right so if you click on that stake Now button here you're landing on this other page here um I've already connected my wallet here for you um it pulls the act the current xan price here the xan price is the xandum token right that um um um powers that storage layer and the storage enable liquid staking right so why is that storage enabled I'll show you that here on the other uh page because we have that nice animation here right with other liquid stakings you get staking rewards you get meev rewards both of these you get with and the me rewards actually you don't get it with any of them with with with you know every uh liquid staking pool just with some but you get both here with uh with um the xandum storage enabl liquid staking but then we get Block rewards right that's a biggie here there is no other Diversified pool staking pool liquid staking pool out there we are the only ones and the first ones that programmatically share block rewards with you the stakers right and block rewards are huge they are huge because the salana chain is in demand people want to get their transactions through they pay priority fees to get their transactions processed and all these priority fees go to the validators and they don't share it with you um in other diversify liquid staking pools it's all for the validators themselves so we are the first liquid staking pool that shares block rewards with you the Staker so that's why the yield is so high right but hey it doesn't end there look at that we have the normal staking rewards the me rewards then we have the block rewards and that's xandum exclusive you only get that on xandum and then we have the storage rewards these are not there yet right but um the the storage layer the the scalable storage lay for Solana that's what we're building at xandum so the xandum uh Foundation is building that storage layer and as soon as it goes live there will be extra storage fees right because then apps will be using the storage layer these apps have to pay extra transaction fees for using the storage layer they pay these inso all these will be um going into this liquid staking pool right so the xand da will keep its cut right so if you buy the xan token you participate both in the success of the storage enable liquid staking and also in the success of the storage layer itself because all these rewards for both liquid staking and the storage layer itself they both go into the Dow uh so you participate in all that when buying the xan token so make sure to get your hands on that Zan token it is listing right now you can buy it on Jupiter um and on Mexi and and uh yeah so that's what it's all about and then uh we have that fifth layer of rewards here which is the boosted Zan rewards and that's something I'll dive into in the end of the video I promised you that right so but now let's look into how it all works here um the pool is brand new right the base apy here the base apy without any boost or stuff like that right it will be between 8 and 11% we expect it to be about 9 9 something per real soon here right it still says waiting for data because we need five epochs uh in like 10 days um 11 12 days depending on the length of the epoch to really show you an estimated apy here but it will be above 8% it will likely be above 9% from the get-go it and it likely be above 10% really soon so and that is because you get the staking rewards here you get the me rewards and you get the block rewards right and at a later stage without you having to do anything you will get the future storage rewards right because all the validators that we are working with they have committed themselves to adopt the xandum storage layer once it becomes available so once it's there from the earliest day and you liquid stake with this storage Ena liquid staking from xandum you will automatically participate in the extra rewards from the storage layer so that's a big one and even today the big one is the extra block rewards here and I'll dive into these details also uh what that means right so um this will be like 9% here and then we have the boosted apy that's with the extra Zan token that you will earn for free just for staking with this pool here right so it'll give you a lot of xan tokens and the xan price is listed up here so the uh the extra boosted apy it'll appear here soon at the beginning of the next Epoch um it'll be around 9% also so you're around like 20% or so total apy just for staking your soul and getting the xans Sal token in return so you are liquid with that xans Sal token you can unstake any time without having to uh wait for the end of that uh of that Epoch and you see here we have different stages for the Boost right um uh there was the hyperdrive stage here with 10x rewards it's already over because this thing was so so successful can you believe it that within just a few days days we crossed that 30,000 so Mark here and we are now in the Launchpad stage which still gives you a 4X in boosted Zan rewards which will result in like 9% boosted apy here right so 9 + 9 you will be 18 to 20 22 is um percent here and you can uh even though it still says taking waiting for data you can expect this type of AP Y when you stake your Sal today right so you can enter any number here in this wallet that I've connected there's 28 Sal in here um I can just take maybe um I don't know three Soul right and then I can say Stak your s for uh for liquid uh xand s here so um yeah so um I I could do that here and then I get zanol back but I already have zans zanol here in my W it um yeah so it's already here um already done that so then I have these zanel tokens here right that are in my wallet so now the question is what can I do with these anel tokens so first of all you can trade on Jupiter right so you could go to Jupiter and trade them back to S so um let me show you Jupiter here uh in a moment so Jupiter is the aggregator so you can swap any tokens into any others um on Jupiter you see it right here and you could say you could sell zanol here um zanol ah here we go right and I could you know sell like whatever3 of my Zeno into Sal right and now you see for 0.3 zenel I get 03013 XYZ so I get more Sal than the zanol here right and that's how it all works the value of the zanol token as measured in sa is constantly going up right why is it constantly going up because those validators that we work with that the xandum liquid staking storage enable liquid staking platform works with right these validators um they work for you right they they they work and they they create these uh apys here that yield for you and that's awesome and now I'll show you and and you can you know with the liquid staking you can swap it back to S any time so you don't have to wait um for the end of the epoch you can do an instant unstake so that's one example of why the these zanol tokens are great um but soon you can go to platforms like Camino and we're working with Camino and with our Market maker to have xans Sol there so you can lend out your xans Sol tokens for a yield and you can maximize the yield by nesting uh these things so that's going to be cool stuff and I'll make another separate video for that one um um but for now you can trade it on Jupiter and it's it's completely uh liquid and um yeah so what I wanted to show you also is here the validators that we work with right so if you go on on xans sol. zm. network here um and and go to uh to validators uh so you see that here that's our and by the way I'll show you how to get there right so you just go to xandum network um then you come to this this is the homepage right um that's xandum done Network and then you just click on stake here right when you click on stake come to this page and then you click on stake now and then you end up being on this page here which is our liquid staking app right and then you have a a more uh tab here and you can go to validators right by the way if you run this a validator you want some stake from us you can do the validator onboarding here you can connect with us on Discord um get some some information uh beforehand but for now I'll show you here the uh the validators and then it takes all the validators and we just launched the pool so it's just going to be like six or so validators that we see here 1 2 3 4 five six um we see how how much they have all in their bond account here and they have a separate bond by the way so they have committed themselves to adopt the xandum storage layer once it becomes AA available that's key here right we only work with validators that will use the xandum storage layer as soon as it becomes available and they've given us a separate Bond here that will be slash if they don't do that right so they have committed not only with their mouth but with their wallet that they will adopt the xandum storage layer as soon as it becomes available right but we see the performance of all those validators here the contributed apy you see some definition here and you see we have 8 point something 7.9 we have a few that are low right now that's just because they are um warming up they don't have much stake yet so they are not even on the leader schedule they cannot produce block rewards because of that so that's that'll change soon and all of these will have like an 8 point something per base rewards here the the absolute leader here is this stakey guard validator here with 8 . 45% base apy and um and and they contribute this apy to the pool here and you can see they have that uh base meev share right here that um they have set up when they run their validator and there is a bonus me share right so if you liquid stake with our platform you get some bonus me rewards that you will not get if you pick this valid to stake natively to right so one validator could choose like okay I share 90% of my of my me rewards with my stakers in Native staking but then they can say oh I can share another like 5% with uh this liquid staking platform with xandi's liquid staking platform so there will be more rewards if you go through our pool here as compared to you stake to that specific validator natively and also if you stake natively you have to monitor the validator you have to um um uh wait when you unstake and stuff like that so here it's all liquid and and we do the reaing for you each and every Epoch uh look for the for the apy here that each validator um makes us and um restake if necessary right if anything change so and then we have the block rewards sharing right look at that here they all share at least 10 most of them 20% of block rewards um with um with you the stakers and that is huge guys that is absolutely huge um you see that here the share rate 20 2020 just one is at 10 and all the others share 20% of their block block rewards which is just awesome um and there's no there's nothing else there and um so yeah so that's great and uh the block rewards is huge right not even not even the storage enabled I mean you can always argue the storage rewards are not there yet they will come and that you don't have to do anything right you can just liquid steak with with xandum liquid staking storage enable liquid staking and as soon as St words are there they will automatically flow in and they will increase the value of that of that zanol um token even more right so that's how it all works and then as I promised in the beginning and by the way don't forget to hit that like And subscribe to my channel but here's what I promised you in the beginning to explain to you what is the actual boost and I've mentioned it briefly here here but let's go back to it um so we have these boosted rewards we're in that Launchpad stage it goes until we have a stake of 100,000 s um so for some time now we will have 4X boosted rewards and how that works is we have a budget of 50,000 Zan tokens each and every Epoch not like per day or per month or per reward season or something per Epoch so each and every Epoch each and every like 2 day period 50,000 Zan tokens will be gifted out just for using our liquid staking platform right so all you have to and it will be shared obviously with all the stakers right and it will be divided by the next threshold um so the next threshold for uh um for this here is ,000 Soul right so um if you stake a th000 soul uh divided by 100,000 so that'll be 1% so you will get 1% of these 50,000 Zan tokens just right into your wallet right so um and uh and now we have the Launchpad stage so it is boosted by 4X right so it's not 50,000 that's in our budget just for rewarding you guys it is 200,000 right 200,000 xan tokens you will get them as rewards right you don't have to buy them at an exchange you will just get them and you know participate on all of this because the Zan token is one of the tokens with the greatest utility on all the Salo chain because it governs the zand da and the xand da is capturing everything it's capturing the the the income here from this liquid staking platform because the liquid staking platform is charging a 5% Commission on the rewards that are being paid out these 5% commission they don't go to me or to xandum Labs or not even to xandum Foundation they go directly into the Dao which is governed by the token holders right so you will have that benefit directly in the dowo and all the storage rewards that will come up later they will also go into that Dow this is unique look for it everywhere everywhere you have like a centralized organization that wants their profit and stuff like that here it's all governed by the xan token holders so the xan token is an awesome thing to have it's an awesome thing to hold um over a few years until that storage layer is really there because then the full value will be realized right so yeah if you do that and if you stake your salt you know if you have some Sal somewhere you're just leaving money on the table if you're not staking it you should be liquid staking it especially now that we have the xandum storage enable liquid staking platform because that is you know eliminating all the disadvantages that you had before with liquid staking because none of the liquid none of the Diversified liquid staking pools is sharing any of the block rewards with you right the xandum storage enable liquid staking is the only platform that does that right so again go to xandum network go to that stake Tab and stake your soul there you get the Liquid xans Sol back you can trade it freely on Jupiter you will soon be able to lend it or you know to to to to even um you know leverage to do the leverage lending and lend and Len again and stuff like that you can do that all on Camino it's going to be available soon and I will be doing a separate video for that so make sure you absolutely hit that subscribe button if you haven't already done so so this was my introduction to a gamechanging staking platform right there are so many Innovations in there right The Innovation is sharing the block rewards The Innovation is we have yield Defender which is our own um uh smart contract running on the on the salana platform that will be administering all these bonds right so if as a validator you want to work with us you need to set up a slash Bond and the bond is there to have all the block rewards there that they will be taken from each and every AO Epoch and go into the pool to be redistributed to the stakers um but we have a separate bond for the promise and the pledge to use the storage layer adopt the storage layer once it becomes available and yeah the storage enabled liquid staking in itself of course is a big big innovation it's using that Innovation that we're doing here the the scalable storage layer for salana and all these extra rewards um go into that Zen token so yeah this liquid staking here uh it is a real game Cher you should check it out um go to xandum network um click on that stake Tab and uh and stake your soul there in our storage enabled liquid staking which is a real game Cher because you know it gives you all the rewards and it gives you the liquid token that's tradable and soon it's going to be lendable um on on Camino and and you you know will be participating in defi in so many different ways and um yeah so here's one last request that I have right this was a lot of things that I um explain to you here in this little video right I want to know from you what do you think what have you done before right did you have any Soul or will you be a firsttime soul owner um let me know that in the comments right just tell me hey you know I already have S I already have a wallet or say no I've never owned any s right I want to know let me know in the in the comments and right under this video and then and then if you have saw have you staked it before have you native staked have you liquid staked have you liquid staked with anyone else so I want to know all these data so put this all in there um into the comments I engage with you personally I've done that in the last video where I talked about the the launch um of our 70 million token and I gave you an Insight on you know how it all worked and stuff like that so check that one out in the end screen that will appear here um but for today uh thanks so much for listening guys um catch you later bye peace
