TITLE: Ep 380: Why dApps Are Rushing to Xandeum
================================================================================

Hey, hey, hey everyone. Blockchain Bernie here with my latest episode, the Xandium. Xandium. The Xandium farm is live. So far means it's a liquidity pool. That's where we enable you to be able to trade the XAN token into each and every other token. And the farm means there are extra rewards. So for providing liquidity, usually you get your fair share of rewards. you get your share of the trading fees that people pay when they trade the XAN token. But with that farm, you get extra rewards in the form of ZAN tokens. It is over 2,000% annual percentage yield at this moment. It'll, you know, um fluctuate a little bit with the total amount of liquidity that we have in there and with the trading activity that's taking place. But I'll show you in this video how it all works and show you how you can provide liquidity and why is liquidity so important. We want people to be able to trade their Xan whenever they want to buy and to sell without having a huge price impact. Right? If you want to sell some meaningful amounts or buy some meaningful amounts, you will be pissed if that has like a 10% impact on the price, right? So that's why we need that liquidity. We have over $140,000 coming from me or and or Xandium Labs and that is locked for six months. So that is a big big sign of trust. We locked it on a streamflow contract for 6 months. So, it's all locked in there. You don't have to lock it. Even though we will appreciate it, right? If you lock it too, it will be a great sign. It will help the community and it will help the Zen token price, but you don't have to, right? So, for now, if you provide liquidity, any amount, it can be $10, right? you will get your share of the earn it of the trading fees and you will also get your share of um the XAN rewards that are being out there as a reward. So, let's look at that. We're on radium.io here. You see that here? Radium.io. You go to liquidity here. So, they have a bunch of tabs up there. You go to the uh to the liquidity tab here and uh well let me actually uh go to that thing here so that I can show you. You go to the this liquidity tab here and then you type in you go to the standard right not the concentrated pools the standard pools um because only on standard pools it makes sense to lock them for a long time right and you type in z for the zan pools. So then we have this van pool here and um and it shows two pools. Um the lower one is not the one that we want to look at. It only has 13,000 of liquidity. It only gets uh very little um um trading volume. As you can see here, this one is the main one. It has 146,000 almost uh in liquidity uh locked here. So that's all great. And by the way, let's have a look at the Zend uh token here. Um uh it's over 1 cent again, right? So it's above 1 cent, which is awesome. And um that's like a 4.5x from the trough that we had um like only eight weeks ago, right? Not so long. It was like 22 cents or something. Now we're over 1 cent again. Thank you everyone for your trust and all that. And we want way more liquidity here. We're at 145,000. We want that to go up to like 300,000 within say the let the next four weeks or so, right? So, every little contribution helps and you will get your Xandium rewards, right? So, Radium lists it here with that little Zandium token and if you hover here, you get the breakdown, right? It's 2,96% as we speak. You get 8 8.8% just from the trading fees, which is a great APY, but you get the Xan rewards extra. You see that this ends on 429th. So, we started it for 7 days, this extra incentive, but we will keep it on. We will extend it after these seven days for, you know, months and months to come. So, you can build on these rewards here. And isn't this awesome? Over 2,000% APY just for providing liquidity um into this pool. So, please um um provide provide your liquidity uh right here. So, that's awesome. And um yeah, so so that's how it works. You just click on that deposit button there and you have to provide both is the pool is soul versus zand. You provide both both soul and zand 50% each right and radium will help you with that. You just type one thing in like you want to deposit one soul and then it tells you how much zand you need to deposit or you say here's 10,000 zen and it tells you how much soul you need to deposit. So you can't do wrong there. It's just just be aware you have to deposit both uh tokens and you deposit them there right there is you know don't be afraid people tell you a lot about impermanent loss that just means if the token price between Saul and Zand gets disconnected let's say let's say Zand is rising more it has been r it had been rallying actually the past eight weeks let's say rallies more against salt right that just means of the of the zan that you put in there, it'll get sold, right? People will buy Xand more than they buy salt in that pool. So, some of your Xand will go away and you will get soul in return. But that means you've been selling some of you some of your salt um as you go and you might have get gotten a better price if you've waited or something like that, but it's not really bad. It's not really a loss or something, right? You provide that liquidity. If the other thing happens, people want to buy more salt and sell Xand, then also, you know, you get a lot of Xand at at at quite good prices, you know, at the you you kind of DCA out of Xand as you're in there. So, the impermanent loss is not really that big of a deal, right? It just changes one token into the other and you only provide that amount of liquidity where you can afford that to you know get get traded between these uh these two things but you get like the 8.8% in the trading fees plus you get a lot a lot of percentage points in those extra ZAND rewards. The extra Xand rewards are not locked or anything. They're not locked for 12 months and you they they just come out immediately. you will see how um how radium does that if it sends you that like with each and every trade or I'm not really sure how they do that but it comes immediately. It's not a lot. It's a great way to help the Xanium community. Thank you everyone. We need that community. We need that liquidity. That's why we're putting these these rewards on there. And we would be super super thankful if you help us provide liquidity and you know secure these 2,00 something% APY for yourself. So for today though, thanks so much for watching guys. Catch you later. Peace.
