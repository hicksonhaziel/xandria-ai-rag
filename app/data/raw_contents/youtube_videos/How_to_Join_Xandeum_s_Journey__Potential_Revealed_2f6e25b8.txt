TITLE: How to Join Xandeum’s Journey: Potential Revealed
================================================================================

so we talked about what xandum is all about why we need it so badly but I really want to know how do we get there how do we get people involved how do we make sure that this thing is actually taking place yeah great question thanks action yeah so how do we do it first of all we're building it right now right so as the state of things um as we're talking about this right now we're in the middle of building it and we're building it in public I think that's also something that hasn't happened a lot right we have that road map with 30 releases and we partitioned these 30 releases into six erors right so I'll go into into these six erors a little bit but each and every release is planned out right now right what it's going to cover and of course it can change right I mean it's like no plan is is you know show me one project where everything goes to the initial plan that was there but we feel this plan is really really thought out um and we have six eras and we just call them the Deep South South the mine era named after the German river main which you might also pronounce Maine if you want and then there's the central era the coal era and the north era right so we have these six Aras it's a journey through the country of Germany from south to North right um so and we start with and each release in these eras is is named after a certain city so the first one is the city of constance situated by Lake constant it's one of the southernmost points in Germany um not the southern Mo but it's quite South right so it's the Deep South and the constant release is ready the our team is working on the fryberg release right now the fryberg release is already it's just the second release in the Deep South and then we already transition to the South era and in the South era we will have a fully functional prototype right it's a working prototype of everything starting with the munic release which is the first one in the South era um and that's going to be a big big thing because then we have all all components in the architecture and I already talked about the dock in the in the last video running on these RPC nodes we have another component called Atlas and Atlas is the one kind of the distributed database that knows what file what path is stored on which P noes what um what redundancy we need and the apps can can request their redundancy right there can be apps that say I'm fine if my data is always stored on just three p notes right and if one fails we just find another one and we have eraser codes and stuff so we can recreate the data if one of those P noes fails and then there's others that say well I'd rather have them on seven P noes right and there might be Mission critical ones that say well I need 43 P noes right um I love prime numbers by the way if you recognize I've noticed I've noticed but but okay so the way you're explaining it though Atlas is essentially the DNS for this file system it points where things are supposed to be yeah yeah absolutely and and then the third component is what's running on the P noes the provider nodes and there we have two things we have the pods the pods software that's connected to Atlas and that's where things is really stored that's responding to the challenges that's executing the actual commands and then we have an administrative guey where you can kind of manage your P Noe and that's called xand minor we think that's a nice name and and um and that's that super userfriendly thing that we that we talked about already in the previous video so those are all the components that we have and with the munic release um we have that working prototype and then there's a lot of other releases in in the South era that make this prototype more look like something that can really be used by you know production software by by software that's really out there and and where we kind of put real main net crypto at risk pay real fees and stuff like that and that's going to happen in uh what we call the mine era and the first uh release in the mine era is the Frankfurt release situated by the mine River of course and um with that Frankfurt release we have an MVP a minimum viable product and we will build our first on mainnet already in that Frankfurt release that's way earlier than we um originally planned so in that Frankfort release sometime mid uh 2025 uh we will have that minimum viable product we will have our own Wikipedia clone a decentralized Wikipedia and there's lots of controversy about Wikipedia these days and making this decentralized it's going to be a big thing and we might even have some some other demo app like that's a little bit simpler than the Wikipedia um like a guessing game that we have in mind and um and we have a lot of people in our community that want to build apps storage enabled decentralized apps on on xandum and want to be one of the first so most likely it's not only us that have the first apps maybe there's some other uh folks already out there right and it's a little bit like like 2000 when was that 8 or 9 when the App Store came out the early apps were just Apple apps right they demoed what you can do there right but then came all the other apps right and we're Rec replicating that um that approach right we're going to do our own apps and they won't be these demo apps like the decentralized Wikipedia they won't be controlled by xandum or even xandum Foundation or not even by the xandum Dao in any way right I feel like this decentralized Wikipedia I feel we just want to make it as a donation to the world right it's going to be 100% decentralized by its own run by its own token it could be the the info token or whatever the token name might be and um and you know I I don't want to be a big holder there I don't xandum to be a big holder right it's just the first contributors that write the first articles and the ones that engage in that in that Wikipedia da and on and that stuff and and we do that just to Showcase what we can do yeah it will say you know powered by zium right so it's an ambassador for for sandium um and it's also showcasing it to the developers because that obviously will all be open source so the code is out there and the the intention is for entrepreneurs that want have some business idea and we want to build some app but it has to be decentralized yeah that they see in the code there oh that's how easy it is to build something with the storage layer on the blockchain right and then and then think like oh I always wanted to do what a decentralized Airbnb or decentralized eBay or something cut the middleman don't have to play by the rules of Airbnb they can censor anyone they can do whatever they want right and and and just be self-controlled like a little bit like the when when I hear Airbnb I always think about couch surfing that was there before Airbnb it was kind of the same thing but it was all for free right right no absolutely yeah now you mentioned um Community a couple of times I'm really curious into that aspect 40 plus redundant nodes for your data that sounds awesome but you kind of have to build out for that how do you plan on you know uh including the community the zenium community and not only deploying noes but also being part of governance yeah so here at zum you know just as much as we're important you're important too the community is everything and let me reiterate we're building out infrastructure without the community this is not going to go off we need the community just as much as you know we need ourselves here and when we build that community commity out you know through the Dow and and through all our social media channels and Outlets out there you know we're making sure we're being as transparent and honest as we can and telling everybody what we need where we are and where we're planning to go so the community we want more people interacting please join please please talk to us tell us tell us your needs tell us your wants and we're listening trust me yeah and and you know it's I keep repeating that sentence so often we already have the best community in the world right and at least from my experience and I've been doing things uh in my life a lot and had different communities but these guys that we have right now they want to really be helpful they want to be part of this early on they want to actually run infrastructure you know expend their own money to to run that infrastructure we don't have that that community that you see everywhere like oh I can get some them for free and you know I click some likes and then I get some tokens and then sell them off next day right we have real real guys here it it it's almost like that early salana Vibes that we have here for um for all our stuff and um yeah it is it is it is so great to have that community and and you know it's even if it's a lot of work but we we we need to do it we want to have that community and when it grows to you know buy factors a thousand or 100,000 or whatever um we still want to keep these Community Vibes it also means we need to uh we need to police it right it's like that's the governance that's that's the question are you going to be handling all the governance are you in charge of everything or do you want to hand it off to the community that's a huge deal yeah yeah we hand it off to the community there's the xandum Dao out there that does everything and um of course course the xandum foundation as of today is holding a lot of tokens but usually xandum Foundation isn't voting uh in any of these proposals and we're we're doing that you know in a gradual way right we're it's not like in the early days all the community has has all the say because we still need to build it right so um if the community had like all the funds to build it and do all the marketing later on and do hackathons and stuff like that that would be a different thing yeah um but we're doing that in a gradual way and here's also one thing right and where we really differ from almost any other project that I know about right all the fees all the revenues that will be coming in right and it's like a like a blockchain in its own we generate Revenue by collecting fees for each and every transaction right so all these setups as I call them the storage Ena decentral ized apps they uh have to pay fees to store stuff on on a storage layer these fees go to 94% to the P noes the P noes will be able to and and they do the actual heavy lifting so who does the work here gets 94% of their rewards and they can decide by themselves how much do I pass on to my stakers right all the PE noes need to be staked and how much do I pass on to the validators that challenge me and all these type of things right so and there is 6% left out of these 6% 4% will go directly into the xandum Dow okay to all the xand token holders right it goes into the Dow Treasury and then there's another 2% you might ask what that is that is a reserve within the xandum foundation it's not any centralized organization it's not xandum Labs it's it's not me or Sean or action uh it is going into that Foundation reserve and that might be used to raise more money in later stages to fund this whole um uh Endeavor to um to um fund the development and then later on also fund the marketing and as we've seen it with salana right they raised most of their money when the technology was already there yeah and then they raised a quarter billion 250 million roughly I don't remember the exact number just for marketing just for doing those annual events the break points just for doing the um the hackathons and you know funding everything and getting all those developers to build on salana rather than on ethereum or Avalanche or anything right and we will once our technology is there our marketing pivots to that as well right right now we're marketing to pee operators if you want to run a p Noe do it right and we you know ultimately we'll need millions of those but we do that in stages also and um but then once the technology is there all our marketing will be shifting to finding web 3 entrepreneurs that have great ideas right think of like Hive mapper it's a great app on salana that where you they they sell those dash cams you can take a a video footage of wherever you drive and they map the world and build kind of an alternative to Google Maps um but why is that an why do we even need an alternative to Google Maps they make it seem like it's decentralized right but it's not it's a it's a cent Hive mapper is a centralized business it all goes to that centralized business and they sell off the maps with real money to real people as a centralized business right only thing they do is they pay you in tokens right which is kind of probably cheaper for them than paying you $ll for for recording these videos right had xandum been there back in the day they could have built it on xandum and we could have a real decentralized version of Google Maps that would be cool and then everyone would see well why would I do that with Google Maps let's do it with that right with Hive mapper great app happy they are on salana and they are not you know not saying they're a scam or anything right um it's a great app and and I love them being there on salana than anywhere else but you you know it's not it's not decentralized right and and they can't really they they they published something like 2 three years ago oh we're experimenting with storing stuff on filecoin and stuff but they can't filecoin is not designed to do something with smart contracts or stuff like that it's a standalone storage solution right it doesn't store fast enough it doesn't you know retrieve fast enough there's a lot of limitations when it comes to that yeah um how are you going to get these people to build on xandum I think um it's going to be very similar to how salana did that um annual events um um it's for salana it's called breakpoint MH um I love to call ours xan storm so that one I like it I like it too I think I have the domain xand storm. Vegas so that'll be cool cool um and um getting people into these events having easy to understand documentation having all our demo apps open source um having you know different different for different types of of people that have different levels of skills yeah and um having Community grants for people building stuff that you know furthers the goal of the goals of the of the ecosystem yeah um and we have we have um um you know funds there in in the tokenomics set aside for these things and and hackathons and yeah that's that that's the way it works and sounds Grassroots to me and you know contrary to Solano we don't have an incumbent uh player like that 300lb gorilla in the room as they had with ethereum Y right so right now we're we're you know we have the first mover Advantage yeah and and we aim on keeping that and we have to be fast and that's the reason we're hurdling through all these six eras I mentioned the first three and then after that um we have the the central era where we introduce uh where we introduced the bft Byzantine F tance among those P noes so we make that storage really blockchain grade right that it's the storage is completely decentralized and then uh and then we have the coal arrow with uh that's the coal mining era in Germany where I happen to be born and raised and um uh that's about the uh the fee markets and then we have the north era which is about performance and scalability and all these type of things hardening that whole thing and our goal is to hurdle through all these six erors in this year of 2025 wow obviously only having like 90 95% solutions for all of these stages and it needs to be polished after that and that's going to take years right Sal is still in beta right and mainnet beta um but we want to to hurry through these eras in this year uh have like a complete solution with everything we ever fancy all the bells and whistles that we fancy it to have um by the end of this year and just you know speed through everything just to keep that first mover advantage and obviously with all the P noes that we're that we're building on the way um we're going to keep that that moat up because even if someone copies it they can't get all these thousands of P noes overnight oh I love that now since we're talking about the how here look at the camera and tell these people how they can get involved oh well go to xandum network and on the upper right hand corner you can sign up to all our channels um so that is our email list or Discord and and our X Channel you can buy the xand token that's probably the easiest way to get involved because we're super super early with that Zan token with all the economic benefits that I mentioned with all the the um governance that's in there and everything um no Financial advice here today but I feel we're very well set up to get like a,x or probably like a 5,000x or something over the next five years in that Zan token that's why we're building that and um it is not just so just a you know uh just a pipe dream here it's it's it's rooted in the fees that can be generated with this Sal these salana transactions and it's rooted in the vision that once the storage layer is there people are building those apps the other apps will become dist become extinct right who will build bu an app that's not uh that's not storage enabled if we have that storage layer it's it's like iPhone apps that don't need an internet we had them in the early days but now they are extinct so yeah that's the way you can get involved and um buy that xan token sign up to all these lists and run a p note yeah I mean if you're on xandum network already you might as well just go read through our website read the green paper read through the eras that Bernie mentioned and learn more about it why not you're already there that's fantastic I appreciate you guys so much going on over this information it not only covers the like why we need this stuff so much but how people can get involved I mean that to me is everything getting more people involved in things that they can believe in and ultimately build on so if you're a builder make sure you're checking this thing out as soon as possible I appreciate you guys
