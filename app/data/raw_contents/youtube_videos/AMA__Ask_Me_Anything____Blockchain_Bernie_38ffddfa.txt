TITLE: AMA: Ask Me Anything! | Blockchain Bernie
================================================================================

hey hey hey hey folks it's blockchain Bernie here this is my AMA ask me anything which I'm doing on a regular basis actually so I have status updates about the zandian project I have these amas like about every six weeks recently let me know if you need them more often or less often and um yeah I'm also you know streaming and uh reporting about General blockchain stuff but especially keep you update updated about the progress of the zandian project all right we have a um a Discord so in Discord there's also a channel called AMA question so if you're not on a Discord go to xandum dcom our website I'll show you our website it's uh uh it's right here so here in the top right you see uh the Discord so you can click on that Discord icon here to get on our Discord um server and then also get on our email list which is especially important these days um because there will be exciting things going on anytime soon where you need to be there on the day of the launch to get the most out of it right so there will be huge huge boost factors on the day of the launch there will be a series of emails in the form of videos that can only be watched from those emails so you need to get on that that email list and also follow us on X follow xandum follow myself blockchain Bernie and um yeah so that's what I'm doing on these channel here and um yeah this is an AMA so I see a couple of guys uh here in the chat Wonders of the World hello from Switzerland hello from Las Vegas uh Robert hedar hello from Bavaria nice nice and from Austria lots of German speaking guys here um kryp Tony is there good to meet you um Peter machala uh from Slovakia uh Ian hey Ian Alan moris from the UK all right so let's dive into it I've already had a few questions um on our Discord um um lonstein is here awesome John good to see you hey from Washington State and um yeah I mean let me start a little bit with some of the questions that I already saw on uh on Discord about um the progress of the devet and uh the P noes and everything um so um the salana breakout you mean the salana breakpoint um conference so the the news is we're there we have um we're a big sponsor actually and we have a what they call a deluxe um Booth um and actually have we have negotiated with them that we have a second booth on the dev sta Dev stage so we're going to be there with two booths and um our a big sponsor all their speaking slots were booked out so they only have a limited of speaker slots and while that is a sad thing you know in hindsight we thought like well you know we have our things to say on our booth and um with uh with these speaker slots it's often there are so many people there you never know who's listening who's not listening so yeah we'll we'll live with uh with what we could get and um yeah so they didn't accept me for the for the speaker slot so uh that's the new about that but you know that doesn't that doesn't make a big difference um it's going to be a great event there uh for Singapore so we're making more and more progress with the preparation there and um you know here are my minimum goals on the timeline because I had so many questions about the timeline and I 100% understand that right on the other hand it's just like things are so hard to get planned first of all because we're doing something that has never been done before there is no blockchain out there that has a scalable storage layer that has an extension of the account model that is part of the blockchain right the blockchain can do compute it can run code on the blockchain and it has accounts right ethereum has accounts salana has accounts but these accounts don't scale right and and I keep getting questions like what's the difference to shadow shd W and stuff like that they don't do that storage layer they don't extend the accounts that are an inherent part of the blockchain to be able to scale capacity wise out there right and let alone they don't do that with kind of a second layer of nodes um the validator nodes we have the validator nodes but we also have the provider nodes that do this actual storage there and these P noes are being supervised by the v- noes and let me tell you that this is tough stuff right this is a tough tough problem I believe it's going to change the world but it's also a big BET right it's a big bet on that blockchain is going to be used as a world computer as a replacement for centralized servers so that you can run any app that you can think of any web 2 app that you can think of you can immediately also run it on web 3 right that's a big bet and it is is in there today and I see that with so so many people that I talk to they just cannot imagine that new world because it's so far from what's possible today with blockchain right all those apps that we see are quite limited just because these apps don't have access the developers of these apps don't have access to a storage layer so and it is tough stuff we have that intermediate product which is liquid staking and that is so tightly coupled to our goals of the xandum chain right because it's going to catapult us into visibility in the salana chain so with that booth that we have on um uh on breakpoint in Singapore you know we will promote that storage layer and with the liquid staking pool it's going to be like if people stake with our liquid staking pool they will make sure they will get the extra storage rewards which will be huge when they liquid stake with us not from day one because we're not live yet with the storage layer but once the storage layer comes um then whoever Stakes liquid Stakes with us uh will get these extra storage rewards so that's going to be a big big unique um selling proposition for the xandum liquid Stak pool and then also think about it we are going to be the first the first liquid staking pool on the salana chain that will share block rewards and block rewards let me tell you this they are a big source of income for salana validators these days just because so many transactions are being processed on the salana chain and the validators earn money not only for validating which was the case you know um before there was the big run but right now um the the validators also earn a lot of money a lot of soul for creating blocks right because block space has become scarce people want to get their transaction through they want to get a block produced with their transaction being part of it that's why they are paying up with priority fees so users in defi in everywhere are paying up with priority fees and these priority fees go to the validators and these priority fees need to be shared with the stakers and we are the first pool you know the first pool that shares these block rewards with the stakers that's why the apy will be just awesome for anyone and anyone who's involved in the zandian project please help us with all you have to make that liquid staking pool a success be there on day one sign up to all our lists and stake some s if you have some and and need to get it staked with the xandum liquid staking pool because that's also going to be a source of income for the xandum pool Foundation the zanan pool Foundation owns that pool there will be a pool commission that flows to the zanan pool foundation and the zanan pool foundation will then have the funds to pay it onwards to xandum labs to build the software that we need to build so there were some questions about funding and stuff like that there has been no additional funding that that has not been announced already and we will publish the tokenomics obviously of all the X andde tokens so you will see where the X andde tokens go to there will be a big reserve for the zandian pool Foundation um and there will be a small pool Al team allocation and we're all going to publish that um but it's going to be quite a significant amount of all the X andde go to you guys the guys that have points the guys that uh have Zan from uh purchasing nodes and um this pool product is really really important and our goal is to launch it really really soon there was a question also when is soon but you know I don't want to answer all these questions in a large monologue here um let's save some time uh for some more questions here right okay so Olaf from Mexico oh that's awesome um good to hear that uh Ed rice hey Bernie Alan Mars hey Bernie when is liquid staking going to take place so as I mentioned this liquid St making pool is so important for our whole project right because it's linked to the storage layer the storage rewards as the validators will be getting them they will go into the liquid staking pool it's going to push our name forward within the salana um community and it is going to be a source of funding right that was the question so no there's not the way of VC funding it's it's it you know we we're not in talks anywhere there's no uh special allocation that that you guys don't know about or anything but we are earning money from our Solana validator right it's a big source of income so there's no doubt about that so that's why we're taking care of that and now we're expanding on that with the liquid staking pool and it is important for us to fund the future activities right so it's important for everyone to help make that launch of the liquid staking pool of success and back to your question Alan when is it going to be I don't want to promise so many things I feel a little bit like uh in the position of what Elon Musk was in with his full self driving and all that kind of stuff and it's coming next week and then it takes you know the the the devil is in the details there are so many unknowns here for example just deploying programs on the salana main net can take sometimes a week or so right and and nobody saw that we're talking with all the the the lawyers right now to have you know the all the legal prerequisites in place so they are working like crazy and I need to work with them they need all the input from me right um it takes time but anyway our goal is to launch that liquid staking pool in early August right and we we even have a date in mind but I'm not going to share that date with you right now right but it's going to be sometime in August hopefully you know in the first half of August and um that's the goal that we're working towards and there can there can always be delays um as I mentioned um but yeah it's soon I mean it's it's uh July 21st today so um yeah it's going to come soon and you guys you know you you need to follow all our channels and especially the emails U make sure you receive our emails right that's a big issue also uh email deliverability right it's it's so easy for these emails that come from lists to get stuck somewhere in the Spam folders and stuff so whatever you can do there to uh mention that it's that it's a legit email you can respond to it right then your email system um um knows like okay um I responded you guys responded to it so it must be a legit email address or there are some wh listing functions you need to figure it out with your email tools but you need to be able to receive our emails all right Alan Mars again okay at last you tried next year I don't know what that's referring to but anyway um Ed rice I like to gamble uh John Spence understandably a challenging problem but how far along are you do you have an internal devet up and running uh with Pinos so thanks for that question uh John and also I saw the other questions out there um on on the Discord the way I understand this question is like it's going beyond the liquid staking right it's it's just a question about the storage layer and and the P noes and everything right and to be honest with you we decided and someone wrote like hey it's been 2 years yeah it's been two years right for one year uh we've been busy with fundraising right so I would say the first half year we've been building we've been busy with building the fundraising tool right the the crowd funding tool that we had and then for a year we've been busy with fundraising and then and then we went to the the salana hackathon where not much came out of it but it took us time right it it was a few months that we um um that we used with that and um and now we're doing that pool right and and that obviously is slowing down development on the actual storage layer so with the storage layer there is you know I can actually recommend anyone to um to get updated on on this here it's docs. zm. org right and that's um our early draft here and here you can also see how far we are with the actual design right and there's so much to say here I could walk through all of this maybe I'll do a special video uh walking you guys uh through this here um but you know with the V node supervising the P noes um at doing all that consensus level that it's a consensus of its own um in there and uh logging the Merk proofs on the actual underlying chain and all these type of things there are a lot of challenges there a and it has never been done before right so we're experimenting with all that and and have our own kind of environment where we try out things with modifying the the salana validator um we have that on local machines really really really strong local machines so that we can compile the validator and just run it on a one validator local test net see what happens and to test out all the the the technology that um that is laid out in this in this document here um but the speed of that has been slowed down a little bit through that intermediate product and we need that intermediate product for all those reasons that I mentioned and I'm super excited about it and it has been proven a great way with jeto right because jeto is it's similar in some ways because jeto also is modifying is developing or has developed their own modified salana validator and they had that liquid staking as an intermediate product and they had that linking also the liquid staking only delegates to validators that use their modified validator software so it's a proven uh a proven path and um obviously it takes resources um it's a little bit slower with the actual storage chain um development but we're still making progress in parallel there uh we're learning a lot of stuff we're learning a lot of stuff from developing the the liquid staking pool from running our own validators from you know modifying the validators with our yield Defender tool that we've built um for the liquid staking pool and from all of that we're learning on how we can apply these things to our modified version of the saana validator and um the devet so far has been helping us you know doing some experiments and figuring out how this this whole storage technology works and that means um with an MVP um that's the the question that I see here are you still pre MVP uh of course have you see there there is no MVP out there right so you would have seen it right so it's kind of a rhetorical question almost um that there is no MVP but right after launching the liquid staking pool um we will we will start with a devet that includes the P noes right and that's that's the only reason why we slow that down is to do this intermediate product in between and it's going to help us fund everything it's going to help us get get the word spread out it's going to help us learn even more about the underlying blockchain techn techology so that's why we're doing that and we want to get that done the liquid staking done before way before breakpoint and we're going to have all the narrative and the P noes and hopefully the P noes launched um before breakpoint or at breakpoint or kind of at the same time so that's the goal there right so all right um how many xan tokens can I exchange for X andde that's a great question we have made a decision about that but we haven't published it yet right and I'm not prepared to make this like on the fly a an announcement event or something like that so all these tokenomics by the way we're going to let them uh have them reviewed by an experienced team that knows about tokenomics that offers that as their product um they are a salana um veterans and they looking into that um that tokenomics document but it will be you know for us it's important for it to be a fair launch right so there's no kind of hidden things there um we don't want it to be like a huge uh fully diluted valuation so that's a lot of a lot of people talk about that the fdv fully diluted evaluation so then we float like only a tiny bit and then we have a huge part somewhere in the drawer that we can later float and put into put into the market to um basically fill our pockets uh uh later then and there will be something like that but it won't be like overly huge and it will be fully disclosed and um the last thing by the way we're working on to to get that launch done is the uh the token staking token locking token vesting just to support um uh this this whole ecosystem here um can we oh that's the next question here Ed can we stake our X andde tokens uh when we cash in our points yes so that's the goal um whether we call it staking or locking or um uh even vesting or something um that is to be seen so that's kind of the last very last piece of the puzzle um that we're working on uh before launching the liquid staking pool and and it's important right and you know many people a few people have asked me that already so that's a very very uh good question okay we have Samuel again here from Nigeria yay and I still I I always keep mentioning how glad I am that we are also a geographically diverse crowd here all right what happened to the xipi well xipi is still that app that demo app that we're building ourselves right it's like when Steve Jobs built the the iPhone and the App Store and stuff there were some of the Apple's own apps that demo everything how everything works right so um and that's still something that will be it it will come with the storage layer uh to demo how this whole thing works right because there's so many people that ask what's the difference uh uh between xandum and XYZ right and I just keep repeating it's a storage layer it's an extension of the account model just making the account model scalable and I think it's really groundbreaking but it's also a bet on you know maybe people don't want a blockchain that can run any software that that a normal centralized server can also do uh I personally believe yeah people the world wants that but the world needs to see it right before they can even utter the the the the the wish to want that right it's like uh yeah I think it was also a Steve Jobs quote where where he said like if we would ask people uh or we would we would have asked people before cars came about you know what what what do you want for the future of Transportation they would have just said Faster Horses right cuz they don't can't imagine anything else right and some things some big um Innovations just need to be there um before people really say oh yeah that's what we want right xand storm you planned this event last year on pretty short notice and decided to postpone it are you planning another such event or are you holding off until a certain point in the project we're holding off for now I mean now we decided to participate in breakpoint and be a sponsor of breakpoint so that's what we're focusing our energy on um for this year um but next year yeah it's still a great idea and that's still part of my vision I love to host these xand storm things I love the name by the way and um yeah it's still on the table but not this year uh Matthew Norman uh I am guilty of that I don't even know what's going on missing all the emails okay uh Barry Conway validator nodes currently cost 7,500 which is a large investment for most people and the price will only get higher can you give some indication of the rewards enjoyed by other uh validator nodes so first of all that's a that's a very good point here and when I read on the AMA questions on the Discord like hey Bernie it's been two years right I've been thinking like yeah we needed half a year to build our own crowdfunding platform and then probably a year um we did a lot of fundraising and had a lot of events like a launch and another launch and a devet launch and and and and the devet launch was also frankly part of fundraising right we sold some more more nodes there and then some people are asking oh what's going on with the notes right yeah you know if if we have the capacity to do some marketing as we did for one year we I'm I'm sure we can sell more notes right we just sto the marketing all right so that's the reason we're not selling that many but that doesn't mean it's not a great idea right and um I I think you know at 7,500 usdc and I said that uh many times right it is one of the best things you can participate in this you'd have to do something obviously you have to run your own nodes um and and once the the the validator software becomes available um you can run it so it's not participating off of our business it's you doing kind of your own little business and and running these nodes but yeah then the the the the paybacks are just you know the it it's the best idea um still and I'm glad sometimes I see people that um that get these notes right and uh I forgot the ORD name of the latest one just just a week ago or so uh one went for 7,500 I'm super thankful for that so if you're watching um today uh thanks thanks thanks and um yeah it's going to be a lot of zand nodes and these Zan nodes are the core the xan tokens and these xan tokens are the core of our storage layer that's being built after the liquid staking pool right so there's the handh holders and and you know they they they will be the the the core of everything and uh I can't be um too concrete here because you know it's just uh it all depends on what you do later on and how you run your node and things like that um so it's not like um you know you just invest it and then we we create value for you it's you'd have to create your value off also by running a reliable node and everything and many of you do that um in the in the devet um but yeah I can only recommend if anyone believes in that vision and that big bet that I mentioned uh several times today right the big bet that you know people want a blockchain that can run any software that a real server can run right cuz since ethereum blockchain contract blockchains have become like a world computer right so and that's the bet right if it becomes a real world computer that has a scalable storage layer that has these accounts so that they are not more like the ram of the world computer but they're kind of the dis the SSD and the storage layer of that world computer that that is something that people want to build on and want to build apps that are as full featured and fully fledged as any web 2 app but run completely decentralized without any single instance being able to control that server right if you believe in that Vision yeah you should come on board you should work with us and you know the best way to do that is uh is get one or more of these noes it's honestly yeah that's the it it is the best way by far by any other comparison [Music] um so someone was asking for the exchange rate also for zand for x& and what the limit is we've made the decisions about that they're all in there let us do our last review of all the tokenomics it's part of the tokenomics with that that company um that we're working with and um and let us do our uh you know reveal of these info right and uh it's always a nice try to just try that like hey let's call Bernie or ask Bernie and and let him reveal something it it it is I hope you understand that right it's something that we want to reveal in a concerted way uh to everyone and not just as a side thing it's some AMA here okay wonders of the world and will there only be one option or regular swap so it will be limited for a few days right so there will be like a week or so of a window um before the launch before X and is listed uh and you can swap up to a certain amount of zand uh per node that you own right per Founders equivalent right so you might remember there were Platinum nodes in the beginning and One Platinum node is just another word for six Founders nodes right so if you own two platinums and three founders that's a Founders equivalent of 12 + 3 so 15 right so we will look at your Founders equivalent and then per Founders equivalent there will be a specific limit of zand right so you will have to be a node owner so when you claim your X and you will have to connect to the wallet that you bought these nodes with right it's not enough to just own Zan that you got from somewhere you have to be a node owner have to connect with the wallet that you bought the nodes with and then you still need to have the the xand also um and that amount of zand you can swap into x& so that's how it's going to work and that's a way to reward everyone that has been with us uh for a long time and and owns nodes and and then soon after that the plan is that xn gets listed and uh you will see a monetary value uh for that right and that's something that we've all been uh waiting for obviously what other advertising measures are planned for example interviews uh with YouTube influencers or are there other platforms where blockchain investors uh can be found um yeah so as I said you know it's it's like of the two years for one and a half years we've been busy with like marketing stuff right so at some point we just need to build right and we just need to cook before we can serve a meal um so that's our primary focus now it's we need to build that thing we need to show see you know to be able to show how it works we need to get the P nodes running uh and all these type of things and you know we have funding we have funding from having sold those nodes we have funding from running our validator we will get funding from running the pool and and that's all fine right and when the day is there where the storage layer is working and stuff like that marketing will get into Focus again right but you know we had a marketing phase to just get be able to get started um now building is is front and center and you know for now most of the building and the the developer power went into the pool but that's you know not in vain right it is very very helpful both for all of our Dev team to understand the details and the inner workings of the validators and and staking all that stuff that that we need to build our own validator uh software a and it's also important to get the funding that we need right and I like this sort of funding and it's super transparent all the tokenomics are transparent um I like that that way way more and yeah interviews with YouTube influencers also the YouTube channel by the way this YouTube channel is still a major major part of the equation right so it's it's it it's our means of getting new people on board um it's our means of getting people excited for our products like the the liquid staking pool and um we're going to keep this this YouTube channel up right and it's different from many many other things in in the slav verse or in in in cryptoverse in general right there there have haven't been many crypto projects where that you know have gotten their Community U Mo mainly from YouTube um so it's a relatively under uh under served uh Channel marketing channel right so there's not that much competition here uh which is just awesome and you know we've assembled an awesome team here through this YouTube channel and we will continue to do so and yes we are thinking about how to expand the YouTube channel into other things and you know doing more interviews me getting interviewed me getting on on podcasts and stuff like that that's all part of it but for now you know we need to have the pool running we need to have the the documentation and the narrative and the story for the for the um storage layer um presentable in a way that's really compelling for the breakpoint event and then we're going to breakpoint and then after that we're going to focus on launching the p noodes and building everything that's necessary to launch the PES and at some point you know we just need to scale down uh marketing a little bit because um yeah it's it's you know we can work on one thing at a time okay please include documentation about the data encryption at rest and Transit with your documentation when you get there I think it's mentioned there um but I can obviously we can add some more detail there uh thanks for that uh tip John um Peter hi I am the latest note oh substance 242 thank you Peter I love it and you gave your country somewhere I think I saw it somewhere here uh Peter when you introduced yourself where was it I don't know okay I think you gave your country at some point in time okay so yeah so glad you're here and um yeah as I said it's it's you know if if you want the best bang for your buck um the nodes are still awesome right you can do all these calculations and that's something that we do with all the tokenomics when we do the math uh for everything we don't want to have anything come out there that's kind of economically better than having bought that node right so that's our our kind of pricing umbrella there right and be just because we're so grateful for all the people in the early days having put their trust in us and uh also the ones that bought uh nodes just recently um so we will make sure that you know those people don't be left out there in the rain right okay then Alan Mars again I understand that you cannot say yet about how many xandum we can exchange for the X and the e but can we exchange them before liquid staking goes live and how will that happen yeah I think I answered that right it'll be before it goes live uh there will be a window of a few days or so uh maybe a week and and it'll be limited uh to a certain number of Zan per node that you own Alan G this is not Financial advice but recently my major regional bank has taken my reserve of tokens and assigned a minimum minimal value to it and is counting them as a non-liquid asset in my financial profile okay not sure if that's in the US or not um there are so many different things here uh and it's different for each and everyone okay John Spence also as you develop please include the flexibility to mount simple storage services like a ss3 or Azure blob uh blog blob storage um okay yeah I'll take that as as an input here um and uh and yeah we have that in in in you know normal validator communities also so there's salana validators helping secure the network um that run on AWS and things like that so there's no no point in you know not having uh these organizations in there um yeah okay understood Ed rice uh can you run P noes on a desktop with a 500 gig hard drive yeah 500 gig might be the lower end not sure if 500 gig will work or if we require like a terabyte minimum or something um but definitely the goal is that it can run on a desktop and that all might change right so you know make no mistake I I keep repeating that it's something that has never been done before we're iterating over that we're um we're doing our research we're having prototypes and then itera over it so um it might work out very well in early versions um of of the P Noe a devet and then maybe it might not work out in later iterations and then we might say oh but that's not working because all these people have all these nodes so we need to change our approach and stuff like that right it's all like there you just all need to be aware that we're you know at at an early stage of the Journey with the actual P noes and running the storage layer a lot of things might change right and we all want to know how it's going to play out in the end um but just turns out like I'm just another human being just as you guys are right okay um windows or Linux Ed uh what exactly is the Ed here education or um oh Ed Oh you mean Ed got it uh can you run PE notes on a yeah yeah the PE notes should be running on on either operating system right so we've talked about that we wanted to start with Windows there were a lot of Linux guys just like myself that said like ah we can start with Windows right but likely you know if we look ourselves all in the eyes and then we figure out it's probably you know the most uh the most out there right so yeah let's see um Abdu yo Bernie I trust this man more than my own father okay thank you good to hear and John Spence um and and glad at you here by the way Abdu I think I've seen you a couple of times in here um and John Bernie getting blockchain related software happy on Windows is a challenge especially with security software uh have you already looked at that or will you be asking users to bypass their security um yeah we've looked into that and you know there might be something where they need to bypass um things especially um since you know ports need to be open there and stuff like that so but we might be able to just tunnel it all through VPN or something like that um yeah but yeah good point so this will will be worked out um Alan Morris uh you have mentioned that you will uh list the xde well I only said it will be listed I didn't say that I or xandum will be the ones that list it right um and what price do you expect the X andde to be listed at yeah that's one of these questions right everyone wants to know that um there will be a price Discovery phase and you know there will be something that we hope for but in the end the market will decide right so it all it it might even depend on you know the specific day um yeah so we can we can at this point not have a comment on that one um and Peter again Michael from Discord will the test net launch in July 2024 um which is right now how will be the change from devet to test net for the validators uh what do we have to do yeah so honestly you know everything takes longer than than you think and that's also true for the liquid staking pool um so the liquid staking pool is delayed for for a couple of months and um after we're done with that we're going to plan through what effect that has for um for the other things right but again the liquid staking is super important it's going to help us on so many fronts um but you know it just needed to get done and we we just can't say oh we planned three months for the liquid staking we're not done so now let's do something else right no we need to get it done and um and that's what we're doing right now and then after that we have the time to figure out um a new time plan right okay can always add an external hard drive um you mentioned xandum Foundation before who are they and the relationship to Boku Labs or the other entities involved in this project um so that's a good question so the usual way to do that is you know with all the the blockchains you see the foundation there uh these foundations are normally what's called orphaned entities so that means nobody owns them um and they have a purpose um set out in their um um kind of constitutional uh documents so the xandum foundation is there to you know further the the progress of the xandum uh chain and the xandum software and things like that but it's not owned by by xandum Labs of course we kind of put it into existence but then we we cut off the the the ownership there so that it's a pure um um yeah a pure orphaned entity for the xandum foundation currently there's no stream of income there's the zandian pool Foundation also which is a separate Foundation um it's also orphaned and the zandan pool foundation will be the one that receives the pool commission from running the pool right and these funds go into the pool commission and since the pool commission has its own constitutional documents to um further the needs of of xandum as well um it'll use these funds to pay for development um and um develop that uh validator software uh and P Noe software that we need to run a storage layer right so that will come from the zandan pool foundation and as soon as we have something up there and have the Zan and by the way the zanan pool Foundation owns um a lot of X andde tokens right so the the the the the pool and the pool commission and stuff like that will all be managed by an X andde Dao so you all know the xan Dao already there is an an xn Dow as well so the xende Dow is basically the one that manages that liquid staking pool and the zandan pool foundation will be will be one big owner of xnd tokens in that Dow it will use its own xende uh tokens to vote in that Dow and um it'll receive the pool commission and that goes directly into furthering the needs of of um the xandum chain and the xandum product and if that means placing an order with xandum Labs or Boku labs to develop some validator software then that's going to be the direction there yeah I hope that answers the question um uh Barry Conway Bernie can you give some thought as to the way forward for non-technical node holders uh regarding uh possible hosting Solutions um so that will be different for V noes and P nodes validator nodes and and provider nodes for validator nodes most likely um hosting it in a professional day data center is the best solution even though you could run it from your home I see a lot of guys doing it in in devet from home these days um I see also people doing it in in VMS um on devet these days and that might work for a certain period of time but you know the market for validator nodes and P noes is going to become competitive right so um while some things might be be working for a while um just using cheap hosting or VM hosting or doing it on a small computer and stuff um but everything's built in a way that it's competitive right for the validators you need those vote credits and you need to produce blocks right and you do that in competition to other validators so that's why you want to have the best Solutions out there and the same will be true for the P notes right there's as set out in that document um that I showed you the um docs. ai.org you see the the storage layer uh architecture set out there and it'll all going to be about you know bidding for storage and the actual cost of storage and stuff like that and you know when apps there there's there's app develop ERS that build apps that use our storage layer right these app developers they create their storage buckets on specific P noes right this will be assigned by the validator nodes right the validator nodes with our extended validator software they will know what P noes are out there and they score the P noes right and if you score well you will win a lot of um a lot of auctions in so to speak to be able to store that data right it's the same thing with our Solana validator that zum is running today it's basically an auction of you know what validator is going to produce a block or you know how many uh how many vote credits they get and stuff like that right so there's no easy answer to that and um it's not something that you know where we as a company do something and then tell you exact uh requirements it's it's all going to be a big Cooperative of uh node owners and node operators both for the vnodes and the P noes um and all the technical details as I mentioned are still being um found out right it's there will be iteration over iteration and and we just you know it's not like we're done we've proved everything and and and here is the uh here's the requirements right it also depends on how successful is the whole thing right if if there's you know crazy amount of Need for storage and then also on the validator side for running all these apps the the storage enabled decentralized apps we call them set apps right if there's a lot of these setups um then there will be higher requirements cuz you need to compete against way more others there right so that's how it is and it's similar to what you see in in in many other blockchain projects okay I hope that answers your question even though it was a little bit like um we don't know and yeah it's a we don't know but I hope I was able to explain a little bit on why we don't know when we don't control this whole thing right this is not this is not a centralized thing right it's going to be blockchain all right um John could you provide a way for us to see the major accom accomplishments um each Sprint yeah we can we can try do that but as for now as I mentioned it was mostly about um the actual pool um since that pool is also in competition to many other Stak pools out there uh we didn't choose to publish so much about all the different stuff I think it's like four or five different salana programs in Rust that are being deployed on the salana blockchain um one of them is the SPL Stak pool program that's been written by salana itself right so that's also a very important uh thing security VI security wise for the actual liquid staking it's based off of SPL stake pool and that has been audited like 8 9 12 times I don't know all by you know reputable um auditing companies so we can be really sure that this is you know something that hopefully cannot be hacked and you know isn't maliciously written or stuff like that it's all that code um SPL stake pool that also Powers all the other St PS on on the salana Chain what is custom is all our rewards thing right we have that xnd rewards token we have the the we give you the rewards token for liquid staking with us we give you the rewards token for ownings and and having bought those nodes we give you the X andde tokens for um having points and and and the points can be reused right so there will be lots of stuff in the future and there's still that Zan token so you can use that those points multiple ways right it's not like oh now I claim my airdrop and then and then my points are gone right no those are multiple use uh points right um yeah but once we do these Sprints for the actual validator software obviously yeah we will uh we will uh publish the the major accomplishments and we'll have them in the um uh in the release notes um okay Wonders of the World at the moment there is still a large portion of xan tokens in one fewer hands how should the tokens be further divided um not exactly sure what you mean here maybe you can elaborate a little bit in a follow-up question here um Ed I am a CNC machinist and I am working on an engraved plate with the xandum logo that I will get framed it will be stainless steel mirror finish uh I want to make one for you Felix and Brad you don't want to make one for me huh what's that no I would be super interested in that so if you can uh just send us a little bit more info and how it's going to look like and how much it's going to cost and stuff like that I'm always interested in in in uh that stuff yeah and again maybe you could hang it in your booth in Singapore yeah how do I get them shipped to you [Music] um yeah you can you can DM me or Brad on uh or or Felix on Discord and uh just discuss it with you we we will like just create a special uh group chat then on Discord with you and then we can discuss these things I super happy about it super happy to hear that awesome um Robert does more powerful Hardware bring me more rewards as a validator in general yes right but again the devil is also in the details right and it all depends on the load obviously so if there's not much load you know more power might not help and we've been going through all of that with our own Salon of validator right and and as I mentioned before it has become a major source of funding a really a major source of funding right I'm not talking small money here s validators is Big Business these days and um it is a science of its own science and art right it's kind of a mixture it's not an exact science right um to tune these validators and you know put in the hardware put in the software the networking all these kind of things but in general you know the more performant your validator is the more potential at least you have um but if you make some mistake there and you put in a lot of Hardware um but you're not being able to put your power on the street because the the the networking is bad or stuff like that then it won't help you right so the these are all things that you know each each validator needs to figure out over time right and that's why I keep saying it's in your hands how much you earn right and and otherwise this would be a security by the way right if I would tell you hey all you need to do is buy a note and then you get this and that Financial return it will be a security which by the way I wouldn't be legally allowed to do right and but it's not like that you know with with with the node you basically buy the right to do that stuff on your own and then it's up to you a and there's a lot of things to figure out right how to yeah so uh hope that explains it a little bit then Michael Hill um thanks Bernie I'm 10 minutes behind but wanted to thank you for the information all right man we're almost an hour again today huh um John Spence thoroughly appreciate transparency in the projects I'm am part of uh yeah you're welcome uh uh John and I think that's that's the way to do it and you know there's no other and and I want to do it that way and it's so much fun for me also to you know have you guys being part of this and being transparent and and on the AMA Discord Channel you know there were were there were tough questions right and I was happy to to read those and read them here today and and respond to them as best as I can because I just believe yeah that's almost the only way to to to bring this thing to a success cuz you guys will only spread the word about us if you feel it's a great project and you feel like we're in the in the right place here together um as a team and everything and yeah let's read it here again thank you for making strides to making the waters more clear and to give us more insights as to where things are speaking of road map update um well as I mentioned um you know as soon as we we have the launch for uh for the pool we'll hopefully find some time to uh to do a road map update and we definitely want to have an updated road map uh going into going into Singapore um by the way our team has grown also so that's kind of a side announcement that um I could do uh here in the uh um in this AMA U let me get some water in the meantime man talking for an hour is crazy um yeah we have Eric on board uh Eric Schuster so he's helping us us with managing advertising campaigns CU that's important with the launch right we need to we want to do some advertising uh get people excited get more people on our email list get more people into our Discord um get more people into our YouTube channel and everything um so we're doing some sort of advertising there and um um getting stuff out and you know getting all the analytics together who who is the target group that we actually need to show our stuff to and stuff like that I'm super excited um about Eric um he's you know he loves these things even though he's not a marketing professional so he's basically a noob there but what he has achieved in a very short amount of time is just awesome and Felix is very happy with him and um and we also have Verena new on the team she happens to be my oldest daughter um she lives in Las Vegas now so so she decided to move from from Germany um to come here live in in in Las Vegas with me um and actually the thing was she was uh thinking about working in uh her field but she got so excited about sandium and everything here that um she wants to stay in this team for at least a year or so um um and then see what's going on and I'm super super happy also and there are a lot of things where she can help just from you know being a family member obviously it's easy to trust with um a lot of things that I wouldn't you know likely delegate to to anyone and uh she's helping with all the YouTube and and and YouTube analytics and uh the shorts that um some of you have seen here and um super excited she's going to be in Singapore also so if anyone of you is there uh you're going to meet basically the whole team there in in Singapore all right um Wonders of the World this means that many shares or tokens are distributed across a few addresses how do you want to distribute them further spread them out so that the share are better distributed okay so we have that light paper so in the light paper um it set out that 50% of the Zan tokens that are being um uh being produced each and every day or each and every second basically um go to the company and the other 50% go to um go to the node owners right and they will be shared equally um among the node owners so and some people own a lot of nodes uh other people own fewer nodes but that's how it is so we're we're not going to um kind of change the the light paper all the the the the whole thing here right now obviously as soon the Zan tokens are listed they can be traded right and then they will be shuffled um all together uh some of the xan tokens that the company owns and when I say the company that used to be labs in the beginning but right now it's obviously the foundation and um these will be given out to um support things like the devet and later on the testet incentivization and uh many other things to to incentivize other stuff [Music] um yeah okay so I mean we have I think almost a thousand or so node owners they are quite quite distributed here and um there might be other phases where you know more nodes will be will be sold and we might have some some more offerings you know after the pool is launched and after the the Pino devad is l and stuff like that we might have some more offerings where uh we have a message out there uh for giving people a reason to buy more nodes and you know when we advertise them and when we have a fixed date when we say you need to be there on this and that date um to be among the firsts then we can sell more notes right and we could definitely do that but we chose to build now right and build the pool first and then build the the peot software and yeah definitely there will be uh release notes with each and every Sprint and um yeah so we're still with that team of you know I would say yeah Three core developers then we have myself I develop also at some points in time especially right now I'm the main guy for the actual validator software um Felix even though he's the head of marketing but he's also managing the dev team right so for everything where that has a guey and stuff where he can be the product owner and say this how how we want to have the liquid staking pool look like he's running a lot of these um uh developer meetings on on my behalf and Brad is doing a lot of the testing um which is also kind of part part of the development right so I would say if you count everyone um that's like six people um and the core actual coders in there those are three and a half right the half one being myself um yeah exactly for many it is simply difficult to understand what is being built here um yeah yeah I hope I could shed some light on I was able to shed some light on that um today so there's a lot of stuff being built on for the liquid staking pool and trust me that's a project of its own with the liquid staking pool itself we can just use sana's SPL steak pool program and that's the best way to do that because it's audited so many times uh from so many reputable companies um but getting all the rewards right right right getting the claim portals um right so if you uh paid attention here no you couldn't have paid attention because I didn't give you the oops where is that yeah I didn't give you the tabs here but there's the claim portal here see that I'm not going to click it now though um but yeah we have the claim portal here right and uh yeah we have the points app and um and everything but yeah there's a claim portal for the ones that get an allocation there's a claim portal for the ones that uh want to swap their X and there's a claim portal for the ones that have points then we need to scan and and kind of scour the blockchain in order to um figure out um um who had how many Soul staked with our pool over what time in order to calculate their rewards we want to have their rewards you know being visible counted up in the guey stuff like that there is so much stuff to develop right and yeah I'm so proud of that team and and all of the teamwork with the three coders and and Brad test testing it Emil sometimes helping in testing as well and and you know yeah Felix managing uh all that stuff keeping all the tasks uh there and giving input for how the GUI looks like the ux lead um yeah Felix is kind of our ux lead um uh that was the question here yeah okay um yeah we are indeed all uh very very excited again it was only a small team that was really asking questions here um but you know that's okay and I'm glad especially John you found the time here because I see so many things um uh from you on on Discord I'm super grateful uh you're helping out with that and and you're also one of the guys that or the the guy that you know posts about milestones and how many transactions and all these type of things so so we mainly rely on you there and and glad you found it into the AMA today and uh it's fine that we have kind of a core team here um asking all these questions I'm I'm happy all these questions will are being asked and and it was kind of tougher questions uh today right so this is the amas as I want to have them right it's not like a uh a kind of little um little round of of friends chatting about only only the easy stuff right uh we want we want uh tough questions and and they were there in Discord and they were all being asked today here um and um and yeah that's how I like it and by the way Ian small team um absolutely so and I think we need to stay at this team size until we've done our homework right and and we have like a proven MVP and how it all works with with with the p noes and stuff like that and then and then once we are there and once we can show that thing to the world that'll be a whole new thing that'll be a whole new world for for the company because then indeed we need to focus a lot on marketing and finding developers that want to build those apps and they need to see a sample app so the zipia is a key thing there and um that's that's going to be very very different there but we need the time to to figure out the technical stuff it is super super tough stuff it's not an easy problem to solve if it was then people would have solved it already right it is tough to have a blockchain that has an accounts system that is scalable capacity wise and by the way salana has so many problems even with their current accounts right and I've said that in some of my videos um and and and anoli himself uh chiming in often times so um that is difficult stuff but making that whole thing scalable scaling it out to thousands hundred thousands of P noes millions of P noes and having them all supervised by the validators that's not an easy feat right and and we put in the liquid staking pool as an intermediate product we're learning on the technical side we're getting additional funding sources and we're getting the idea out by having a project and and a product that people are act actually using right right so if a lot of people if and when a lot of people are are using the zum liquid staking pool the message The Narrative what's unique about that staking pool which is of course the extra storage rewards that will be able to be made once the storage layer goes live that's going to come into um so many more uh heads as as an awareness there developers make the world run that's absolutely true um now you remind me of that famous video of Steve bomber uh where he said developers developers de I don't know if you guys know that video otherwise look it up right Steve bomber developers video uh all right good then I would say if we don't have uh more questions today um thanks so much for giving me the tough questions keep doing that keep doing that also in the comments on all of my other videos and stuff like that um I honestly love that right and and yeah that that's the way to get you guys into co-owning this thing together with us right okay good thanks a lot guys um as always thanks for watching catch you later
