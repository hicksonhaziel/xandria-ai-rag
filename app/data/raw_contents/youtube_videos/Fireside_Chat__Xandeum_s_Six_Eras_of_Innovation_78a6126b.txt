TITLE: Fireside Chat: Xandeum’s Six Eras of Innovation
================================================================================

Bernie thank you so much for sitting down and having conversation about what's happening with xandum because you guys have taken a little bit of a different approach you're not putting out a road map instead you're focusing on different eras and you it's right on the website go under that learn section and you learn about those different areas can you walk me through what those look like and why go that route yeah thanks for having me action so great question yeah we we do have those arrows we actually also have a road map there which is a little bit more like the the the individual achievements and stuff and and our road map is almost interactive by the way right so we're updating it and uh all these kind of things but we're talking about those Innovation eras now and you know what's so cool about that that era concept is we've planned it all out so there's a total of 30 releases wow that we that we bring out and we had to kind of figure out in the beginning man this is kind of an overwhelming type of set of tasks that we have to do to make xandum a reality right and there's so many different things and if we don't break it down into smaller goals it's like you know you're sitting in front of that mountain and are just being overwhelmed and and you know procrastination is a is a human trait with all of us I would say right right and and and we needed to break that down right and it turned out to be you know in our daily work in in in the development it turned out to be so super helpful I I I wouldn't have envisioned that right because we have the sequence of 30 releases already um laid out in front of us and it's a little bit of a break with the kind of um iterative um development or like Agile development concept where mostly people say like well we don't know what the next gr is going to bring right we just look look like you know 10t ahead of us and and then we see where we go the and and of course I'm a big fan of Agile development and we're still doing that um but somehow we needed a long-term goal right we big Milestones I guess big zones we needed to know where we're going H so that we can always keep the end goal in mind right and we keep the why in mind why are we doing that to to help decentralize everything and and accelerate Humanity's transition to self-determination and all these type of things and um and yeah we have these 30 releases and it might turn out different of course we're very very agile and with kind of the how we Implement each of these 30 with some of them we don't know yet some of them we know quite well this is how we want to do it uh with some of them we will see once we get there and we might you know swap out few of these or we might need a few more or can skip some of these so so it's still all agile and and we're you know far away from from that waterfall model right so when I started uh getting into it that was all we had it was the waterfall model right so we had to build like specs and then design and and go through all these phases um so but with with these erors it means that you thought about it you thought it through what do you need to do from point A to get all the way to point B and actually have a successful launch where are we today yeah so so these erors are kind of Best of Both Worlds right of agile and and waterfall um we are in the uh the Deep South era and the era names you know we had to we had to put some names and some of them put historic figures and um stuff like that I just chose to make it uh a journey through the country of Germany from south to North so we have the Deep South The South uh the mine era I pronounce it mine because it's named after the German river of mine and then we have Central we have coold and we have the north right so those are the six eras and let me just go through each of these and what are the goals and you find that on the website also so we start out in the Deep South era that's just two releases and that's just to get started right so you can register your P node there that's the provider nodes that actually do the heavy lifting of storing all these data um so in just in order to get started we have these two releases that constant release and the fryberg release um March 25th March 25th right and um and then we get into the um uh the South Aron right and that's starting with the Munich release and then there's six or seven other releases the Munich release is the first working prototype so everything's there you can build real apps then on the Munich release already on our devet we won't be on mainnet yet um so and that won't change so that's another big big thing we're we're developer friendly right we need developers to build on on xandum and you know a big part of the story is make this super super simple make that Paradigm uh in a way that they know it from Web Two development and things like that so that's going to be the South uh era it starts with Munich which is the working prototype then we go through seven more releases in the South era to make it more and more not like a prototype but like an MVP so an MVP is a minimum viable product but that's more than a prototype a minimum viable product is viable right it's a product it's yeah it's a product and it's viable so it can be run for real use cases you can put real money on the line to run transactions on there that's why the Munich release will be deployed on son main net already we will collect real fees to use our storage layer in Soul they will be distributed real Sol real main net s to the P note operators very cool and that's already going to happen in the Munich release scheduled to be somewhere in the summer hopefully early summer and um and then from that MVP in the South era we go to um oh wait wait and the South era was the working prototype then the Frankfurt release is the first one of the mine era okay and that's where we have that mvp right and that's where our our version our decentralized version of Wikipedia is going deploy it into mainnet and um then what we're going to do is and and with that the storage will be orchestrated in a centralized manner that's just for us to have quick time to Market got it right and then the whole um the the the next error which is going to be the central error that's all about um it's kind of weird right because it's called the central error but it's really about decentralization oh makes it easy to remember makes it easy to remember so that's where this Central component that knows you know what file is stored on which P Noe we start out in a centralized manner there just to have fast um time to Market sure um but then in the central era so like late summer we're decentralizing all that and that's probably one of the hardest tasks that we have to do on that whole journey because then that Atlas component that knows which is stored where is going to be kind of virtualized it's G then the physical Atlas will be gone right in the beginning that physical atas is just a big server with right like a key value dat datase that knows where everything is but then the P noes will kind of administer themselves very cool there will be a leader among the P noes it's almost like its own little blockchain but it will not be a blockchain we will not have a ledger between the the P noes we will not have a ledger of all these um all these different state changes that we have there because then it wouldn't scale either right and we would run into the same problems and we don't need it we just want to know that the content of storage that we have right now is the correct one got it and we have these Merkel proofs for that that we talked about in different videos we log these to the sauna blockchain we do that trust anchoring even to other blockchains as the SAA chain so we can trust you know like like without any centralization right you don't have to trust xandum or something right we can trust that whatever is stored in all the in in that file system in that Global file system that we have is the correct data through that trust anchoring that we do and through and that's all part of the central era through um that Byzantine fall tolerance right and Byzantine fall tolerance what does that mean so fall tolerance anyone can figure out what that means right if one of these P Noe fails we don't want the whole storage layer to be down right so if something fails just other P notes take over and then everything will be good right got it but there are two types of fall tolerance right there is Crash fall tolerance that means if one of these P noes crashes it just doesn't work anymore then the others can take over that's the easy part the crash fall tolerance right it's called CFT but then there's bft Byzantine F tance and that takes into account that a note can not only crash but it can also turn out to be malicious right so there could be intentionally malicious players running their PE noes and trying to do something that's not not legit right and we need to be F tan for that as well yeah and that's what's called a Byzantine fans I think the naming came from some Byzantine generals problems where you know the generals wanted to make the best decision but nobody knows who's um acting maliciously and who isn't so that's coming from that and there are that's a scientific almost mathematical problem on how do we get Byzantine falter and uh spoiler alert it's not easy right and there was a paper called practical Byzantine fter pbft um which came out at some point and um that was being adopted Ed widely by all of these proof of stake chains that we have out there right so starting uh with with with all these with ethereum proof of stake and also with what what uh Anatoli with sa did when he figured that out around 2018 or so the pbft pratical butine furns was all there was right so he was using the current state of of Technology and science um to do that pbft pbft is still complex and then we had this project that we all remember named Libra right so there was another Libra recently now let's not talk about that one um but about the the the initial Libra when was that 2020 or something yeah I mean they they were running for I'm still running that that node okay oh wow cool yeah yeah I I'm not making money but it's one of those things decentralization matters and making sure that we can support people like that to me is important yeah so it was Facebook back in the day so I remember they they rebranded as meta after that that Liber initiative and they wanted to build their own blockchain and XYZ they got so much backlash didn't work didn't work out for them too much everywh so they just withdrew and and they dropped all that code open source to the world right and then uh things like Aptos and suie on that and and built their their blockchains on that and they have a whole new thing of bft I think the Facebook Engineers came up with that in some way um it has a name it's not called called practical Byzantine F tance they gave it a different name and the name believe it or not is hot stuff so you can argue whether that's a great name or not probably for Googling I me you remember it right yeah I remember it yeah but it's not unique if you Google it probably you get a lot of other results right I'm not so sure about that you got to filter through Bernie's pictures absolutely so um it's called hot stuff and that is a whole new way of bizantine fall tolerance that is a little bit more lightweight and we can even strip off more of that fat there because we don't need the Ledger right yeah so but applying that it is really really whole new hot stuff and we've thought that through a lot because we needed to think it through at least as much to be super comfortable that the whole thing is feasible right we don't want to do it and then at some point figure out oh we cannot do that right so we went through all that that that hot stuff technology figuring out that it can be used for these P noes that's why the P noes need stake right it's all it's a very simplified uh stake thing it's like a direct staking there will be a leader among the P noes and and we will know who's which one of these is the leader and the probability of being um selected as the leader will be proportional to the stake that each P note has so it's all these proof of stake things that we know from pbft um they will all be there but we won't have The Ledger and um still it will be a network of of P noes of storage provider nodes that administer themselves that have the Byzantine fall tolerant that are trust anchored to other chains in their ledger so that way we don't need our own Ledger uh which simplifies things again and that's going to be part of the central eror got it what's after the Central Area um after the central era we go to the coal era which is named after that German coal mining um area where I happen to be born and raised in uh starting with the Essen release so Essen for Germans that the city of Essen uh which by the way is like the fifth largest city or so in Germany and nobody knows about it if you don't live in Germany anyway and um and with that Essen release we introduce fee markets and that's also a complex thing right so um fee markets is a whole um whole beast in itself and it has to be Market oriented it has to be supply and demand based just because demand will fluctuate crazy and with storage not even sure if the word fluctuation or volatility is the correct word here because as we all know once we store something we rarely ever delete it right yeah no hard disk is ever large enough right very true so so this storage stuff is kind of sticky right um but still there will be spikes right it'll it'll go up like crazy once there is a successful app yeah so all it takes is one app to show up and all it takes is one killer app right the demand is going to go up and then and then prices need to go up for a certain amount of time to just incentivize people to run more PE notes m and once they catch up and you know thanks to thanks to our technology it is so easy to spin up another PE note right it doesn't take a lot of time right sometimes it's like you know in the in the real economy if we're dependent on on like copper or lead or something and then suddenly we need more it can take five six seven years until until there's enough Minds find new bring it out you know and all of that yeah so we have like super high elasticity I think that's how it's called right so people can spin up their P noes in no time right that's awesome so this price spike that inevit inevitably will come for that storage um they will be shortlived right because people bring up which is a healthy thing because yeah often we see in crypto a lot of people let's have more nodes more more we're going to get a million nodes and it's like and you're only making $3,000 a a month as an organization that's not sustainable yeah and i' I've been asked questions by the way with running those Pinos and there are people that have been running nodes in storage chains right in like um sea and there's plenty of those out there yeah and and some of them have been underwhelming in in profitability and it's all about Demand right so let's be clear about that there's no guarantee of course there's no guarantees everywhere life but there's no guarantee there will be a lot of demand for uh for the xandum chain but I honestly think it will because it's so easy for app developers to build these apps they will see how easy it is to build a Wikipedia they want to build their own stuff and and that'll create that demand we will have that whole share economy um like Airbnb and eBay and everything it can all be decentralized and we can eliminate the middleman and all these type of things but it's also different right it's not just like all these other file systems that are out there it's geared towards developers it's geared to actually have fast retrievable Storage Solutions I like I mean a lot of these things like it literally takes forever to get any data out cuz they're not really made for a daily consumption you know reading and writing as opposed to what xandum is doing yeah yeah and we have the intent to spark a Cambrian explosion of web 3 apps that's our intent and that's the reason we're building this and that's how we differ from Storage chains that were out there they didn't have that intent to spark a revolution of new apps on on Smart contracts right they they they just hadn't so and just by having the intent of course it's no guarantee that it's going to work out that way but uh if you don't have the intent it's never going to go there exactly what you are guaranteeing is that we're going to be able to run some PE noes here and you know put put into action the things that we want to do the type of stories that we need to grow and move forward yeah yeah so that's the whole thing about the coal era um building those fem markets right and then after the coal era we're going to have the um so where were we we're going north yeah we're we're North already and and that's the north era it's starting with the moer release um beautiful city of moner Germany and then from there we go north and that's all about scalability and um and performance right so in in the other five eras we've built functionality mhm um and and with that base functional of course we're already way more scalable than the sauna accounts are yeah but there's always by all experience when you build stuff that's going to be out there for being used by millions and millions of people people there are all sorts of performance bottlenecks that we're going to find there um there's all sorts of um um scalability issues and stuff like that so we're basically polishing the whole thing to make it work at a high transaction volume at a high uh capacity volume at a high number of P noes volume and and that has been the case with salana it was always built to be scalable with transactions per seconds and stuff but as they built it they figured out oh there's a lot of um bottlenecks somewhere and once they hit a certain level of usage then they thought like why don't we scale more than this here oh we need to fix this right so that's the whole point of the north era where we yeah kind of fix the bottlenecks there so North Area is all about optimization optimization for you know high volume and and and yeah what's what's the timeline looking like for that North Area when do you plan or expect us to get there so we have we have a big goal right so if you look at all these erors with you know making that full uh bft among the storage nodes having those fee markets and stuff like that and you know building the whole thing out uh in the beginning normally I would say that's a multi-year project Pro right even to have the first iteration out there right um we're we're going to be going fast here right I think time to Market is everything here we do have a first mover Advantage here and we need to keep that first mover advantage and we will keep that first mover Advantage with your help because you need to run a p note right that's the best thing you can do to to contribute right now and um and building out the number of P noes building out that software one after the other and we're going to be hurdling through these six eras and 30 releases and the goal is all within 2025 wow and that just means you know none of these 30 releases can be perfect right it's probably like 90 95% Solutions in many cases but in order for time to Market we need to go through these really really fast and we will and then there will be like a phase of of a few years of actually battle testing this right and and that's what happened in salana as well right what you know we're still it's still called main net beta right after whatever four years or so of main net and um but you know we have that ambitious goal of of going through all of these uh eras and and all of the these 30 releases uh within this year we're ahead of the Pino launch as we're recording this it's going to be happening on March 25th so we're not even there yet but you know the launch is going to happen with the constants release but we're almost done with the fryberg release right now right in the background so we always do that in parallel what you know what's out on devet is out on devet and we will be developing in our team the next release already got it and try and and test it out on an even smaller Network that we call tret TR that's just a that's just a three validator node and maybe 1020 P node Network that's operated by xandum like internal making sure things work like an internal thing before he goes to devet it's going to be tested out on tret um so fryberg is on tret right now as we speak um and uh maybe even Munich will be out there on try it before we even launch the Pinos that would be cool so you know we're we're quite quite fast now moving forward after all that thought work that we put into you know making that road map and and and mapping out all these eras and we're building this whole thing in public right with with you and with the community everyone can see where we are um in that road map and everyone can try it out on on our Des devet the devet will transition into test net once we go live on on Main net in the mine era and uh yeah was it worth it outlining all of these things before you know hitting the ground running well time will tell but it looks like it right it it was so helpful for us to to to know where we're heading and and having the end goal in mind and and seeing that it's all feasible and that we can get there and and and we have like a uh like a like a good plan right and and it's almost like a master plan right yeah thinking of uh of Tesla which I happened to be a relatively early investor in um they always had that that first master plan where they said like well if we want to come up with EVS we'd have to start with an expensive model right which which was their original Roadster that they sold to celebrities in in in in the Bay Area and in LA right and and then with the money raised from that build a mass market car right which turned out to be the model 3 that was always their their master plan and they had that in mind that when they build the road store they need what they did it for right in order to capture the M Market in in in the next step and I think it's so helpful for us and for the development team to to know what it's all for and where we're headed and what impact it's going to make and uh how it's going to help Humanity to move towards the future where we can all be more and more self-determined and not not controlled by by by any entity yeah the self-sufficiency is pretty awesome and pretty important if we want to live the lives that we want to live not being dictated by anybody else ABS that's why we're here in the US right and not in those countries that we came from exactly both of us yeah both no I mean the effort is not only Noble it's really exciting to see that there are more you know crazy people like myself that actually care about the stuff out there um you know it's really uh rewarding to see people running nodes personally because it shows me that there's people out there that care about the stuff that want to be a part of something greater than themselves and really Supply U maybe storage maybe processing whatever may be to others to really fulfill this um decentralized meta that we're all living in right now where we want to really take control of our data to really take that next step into being self- Sovereign and not having anybody else tell us where where we can or we can't spend our money or where we can or cannot go so having that freedom to me is everything and hats off to you for having such a great outline plan for so many different eras of how you're going to accomplish that with Zend yeah and we just have to know what we're doing it for because otherwise you know building a company going through all of these things and you know cash crunches and having to raise money again all that kind of it is tough right if you don't have a big reason on why you're doing that you will stop at some point in time right so um that's why that's why you need to have that and you know driving Humanity towards decentralizing apps and decentralizing it um I think that's a big one and yeah it sometimes it sounds like something everyone's saying and everyone's like we we enable web 3 and the real web 3 um and that's why I'm doing this V these videos here I hope I hope it'll explain to you why we really think that this is going to make a big big impact this is going to be a big step it's there was a big step from from Bitcoin to ethereum right suddenly there was a whole different blockchain it was programmable right and I think the the the size and the significant of the step to from from like normal smart contracts to xandum is at least as large as the step from Bitcoin to ethereum and that's what I firmly believe I love it now the why is super important so many people go out there trying to build things and they don't even know why they're doing it so I really appreciate the fact that you're asking the tough questions why you're building this thing in the first place getting it all outlined and pushing forward with that mission fig knowing exactly where you want to be with these different areas and you know really setting those goal posts that you are not only achieving but you're letting other people know like you said building in the public we're going to get there this is where we're going this is how we're doing it so thank you for your efforts Bernie um blockchain can definitely be a whole lot better when people like yourself build incredible things with a purpose so I appreciate all your efforts and I can't wait to see where his anium goes thank you thank you
