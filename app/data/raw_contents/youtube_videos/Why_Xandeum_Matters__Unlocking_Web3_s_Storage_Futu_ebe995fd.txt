TITLE: Why Xandeum Matters: Unlocking Web3’s Storage Future
================================================================================

well everybody I am here with two wonderful people from Z we have Bernie and sea and I want to talk to them in this three-part series about the why the what it is and also how they're accomplishing it but let's kick it off with the why Bernie so glad to have you here with us if you can just kick it off with two little things tell us about yourself and why zium yeah action so glad to so glad you're you're having us here and um great question I mean that's always the the big question why are we doing all this and I'm I'm a big fan of you know always start with why right I would never put that much energy into something if I don't have a big reason on why I'm doing that and the story is quite simple you know I'm I'm in blockchain and crypto since 2013 with you know a few years of Hiatus as most people have but um and then got back into salana in like late 20 21 or so and building apps there decentralized apps and I felt it myself as a developer there that it is so difficult to build really really meaningful apps because we're limited on storage right so literally the developer the only place they can store stuff is in salana accounts and salana accounts you can store maybe a megabyte there if you have a lot of money not even a floppy disc yeah and uh you know it starts becoming super super expensive and flat out impossible if we're like over a gigabyte or so it's just impossible to do that right and and you know we want we want real apps we want web 3 and and you know I have that tweet from from Elon um In My Memory where he says well web 3 is more of a marketing gimmick right it's not there yet and he's right right we're talking about web 3 and yeah and and that's how it all started and I think it is important for the decentralization of things why do we want things decentralized if they're not decentralized we have authorities we have authorities that dictate the rules that we have to play by they dictate the outcome of our lives and if you see it in the in in the big scheme of things Humanity has always over millions of years evolved into giving more and more power to the individual and the individual can you know determine its own destiny and and and all these things and that is only possible if we have real decentralization and decentralization is the only reason blockchain is here in crypto right because if it weren't for decentralization we can do it with whatever visa and stuff like that we we we just don't need it otherwise so I think somebody needs to do that somebody needs to make blockchain and crypto real so that we can build real apps like action name me one successful Web Two app and when I say successful I mean like you know ones that in the top 100 of the most used websites or something like that right something like Airbnb Wikipedia name me one successful web 2 app that has been ported to web 3 yeah there there aren't any there aren't any not yet at least yeah surprising huh yeah that's crazy isn't it so so we need to change that and someone needs to work on that and it seems like almost everyone accepts that the status quo was the status quo right nobody's really like fancying that new world where blockchain has a storage layer and and smart contracts have a storage layer and we can build real apps and yeah that's that's that's the big why that we're doing that now Sean when it comes to your side of things I mean I've seen a lot of different apps be deployed claim to be decentralized and they're really not because ultimately the storage layer is never on chain why does it matter so much and if you wouldn't mind giving us a little bit of your background in crypto yeah so my name is Sean I'm part of the xandum team here helping Bernie out we go way back in the past on different projects but as far as web 3 right now I honestly think it's like the beginning of the web 2 era you know just HTML Rich Text um just normal pages on the internet nothing too crazy or fancy like we've seen on web 2 and that's what we are doing here we're making the storage layer to be able to expand web 3 and make it more data intensive yeah Sean as that point like for him crypto and blockchain almost feels like we're stuck in web one even right yeah everything's static you go on any web 3 page and there isn't much to do other than read consume at least in my opinion you could do a little stuff here and there but I expect more and I want more I want to see more out of this so let's do it it's almost like all you can do nowadays is connect your wallet and pay somebody yeah that's about it that's where it ends and read some text right exactly yeah the applications are not where they need to be um it when you say it's feels like web one I mean it's there are a lot of limitations around this um with zenium though what kind of barriers are you looking to break why do we need this in the first place yeah so you know with W with the real why and why I decided to to go through you know all the lengths of of building this thing is I was thinking of breakthroughs also in other fields and one thing that is very personal to me is when I studied compai in Germany back in the day um I was very very interested in Ai and it was kind of a big thing in the 80s right big data right big data back then yeah no yeah it was just called artificial intelligence but we didn't have it the way we have it today right and everyone was super super excited and thought like well how do icial intelligence that's the future and and we were trying to do stuff for like a decade or so but we just couldn't deliver back in the day it was like we had the prologue programming language and we had expert systems and it was all rule-based right and that didn't cut it we we you know everyone thought like well artificial intelligence yeah we can do that now but we couldn't simply because the enabling technology back in the day wasn't there so I lost interest in AI because there was just no progress in the field right and then like in the 2000s there came a technology named artificial neuron networks uh which was a great great technology and that led to what I call a Cambrian explosion Cambrian explosion is like a metaphor with the the Earth's you know era of the the cambrium back in the day and it was just a small part in the history where most of our species just it came up right just out of nothing right there were for for billions of years we only had microbes and stuff like that and then there was something in the environment some enabling circumstance that made you know billions of species just come up just like that within a short period of time within a short period of time and we had that Cambrian moment in AI in kind of the mid late 2000s when artificial neural networks came up and that was the enabling technology and suddenly we had voice recognition with Siri we had um so many different things which then in the end led to those llms that can even do reasoning these days and all these kind of stuff and it all started with one enabling thing and that was artificial neuron networks so that was that Cambrian moment that I feel like blockchain isn't there yet and crypto isn't there yet right it's all those apps are super limited and and they look like crypto apps and they are not easily approachable and there is no databases there's no customer database you can't check your e-commerce order status or and and that's all because blockchain and smart contract contract is supposed to be a world computer right that came up in 2015 with ethereum so Bitcoin was just currency MH but then with ethereum in 2015 it was a world computer you can run apps on the blockchain but these apps are super crippled right because they don't have a storage layer right it's just a normal computer has three components the CPU the RAM and the storage right every computer has that it's always been like that since I don't know the 50s or so so we have the CPU so we run we can run code on Solana we can run code on etherium on all these other smart contract chains we can um um we have Ram which is the accounts the accounts are super fast but they are limited in capacity right you you you can't buy a computer with like um you know a petabyte of ram right it's just not possible but you can have a petabyte on storage right and and yeah that's not there in smart contracts and in blockchains and you know that's that's the reason we're building this to spark that Cambrian explosion in in in in decentralized apps so do you believe that the camri explosion that web 3 needs is the storage layer oh yeah absolutely I firmly believe that storage layer that we're building that's the enabling technology to build all these different sorts of decentralized apps that we just cannot build today and it's like you know the the 10 years from 2015 to to today is like we're stuck in oh web 3 it can be the F it it really feels like and I felt it myself cuz I was you know I was at University back in the day and I was so excited about AI but we couldn't deliver right and and it feels absolutely the same everyone feels excited about web 3 and decentralizing the internet and decentralizing all the successful apps but we just can't deliver and and to me it's obvious what's missing it's the storage layer right so there's obviously need there's obviously um the why is a parent now stick around and let's cover how we're actually going to get this done
