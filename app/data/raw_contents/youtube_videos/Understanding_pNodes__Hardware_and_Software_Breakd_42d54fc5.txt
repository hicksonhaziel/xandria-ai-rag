TITLE: Understanding pNodes: Hardware and Software Breakdown
================================================================================

I'm here with Shan and Bernie from xandum and I want to know what these P noes actually look like because man nodes are all the buzz right now and everybody's trying to run one but what do they actually look like yeah so uh thanks for that question so the hardware requirements as of now are really quite low right but you know I have to say these Hardware requirements they evolve over time right once we go to mainnet there will be a competition between the P note providers and you know some Hardware that did work before it at some point it might not work and I have that same experience right now with my SAA validators by the way right so things change um but you know right now you have the opportunity to run a p note in our devet in our incentivized devet and the requirements are quite low so you with like two gigs of RAM you're fine um maybe even less um two virtual CPUs is fine no special requirement like maybe you know a gigahertz minimum or something wow um so you don't need much CPU and then you should be able to dedicate at least um 64 gabt of memory 64 gabt of storage um to the xandum network so if you have like 80 gig drive or so you use like 20 for the operating system and you can dedicate 64 gigs to the zum Network you're fine so you don't need a ton of storage right now in the devet and you won't even later on right it's just if it's little storage it's relatively little rewards right so it's going to be proportional um and um how's a software deploy I got to ask this because with the requirements that you just kind of covered it sounds like I can get myology you know device actually run a node almost oh yeah absolutely yeah I think you can yeah so and um with the software requirements you install our uh our P Noe software there we have it for Linux right now right it should be running on and I don't know Synology probably has Linux right yeah yeah so so that's fine um and right now we have it for Intel AMD architecture many people want to run it on a Raspberry Pi that should be possible also and you might be able to compile it uh for that arm architecture um so so that's all fine and then uh you just install our software and we made that super simple also right so you just you just have a an Ubuntu instance and then you just run our stuff it will do basic things like making your SSH connection safe disabling password login over SSH you know just like just like um you know hardening your system a little bit for in order to run a p note because that would be the catastrophe if that's opened up to the world right and and it and it sets up a tunnel for you so that from your PC at home if the PE note is running somewhere else um you can tunnel through it and can access our GUI our our you know our web app that is made so easy that Zan minor software that shows you all the drives that you have you just have that slider how much to dedicate you click on dedicate to zum that's it you see your rewards um adding up there you can generate your new key and register your Pino and everything so it is it is super super easy and our software is those two components it's the xan minor software it's that admin interface that's made super super simple and there is that pod software that communicates with our Atlas and which is kind of part of that decentralized storage Network that we have and that that that's where the actual data is stored and that's where the fast communication takes place between other pods or between Atlas and and even the docks that we have on these RPC nodes so the the the Pod software is where you know the the heavy lifting of storage is happening MH and and even that doesn't need a lot of ram so with those two gigs of RAM you can both run both run both Zan minor and the pods and um and yeah all all you need is a is a fast and reliable internet all right you took a lot of the work out for a lot of people cuz like that's half of the battle is getting your system you know to be secure it's getting that tunnel to be set up like that's a pain for a lot of us that are setting up nodes like having that taken care of through your software is a huge deal absolutely yeah well I mean you know if we want thousands of people to run these PE noes we need to make it easy so that's the first priority for us secure and easy that's that's what we need here at zendium yeah so what's it going to look like in devet are we going to have you know thousands of nodes out there or is are we going to limit yeah so our devet is starting out now in the Deep South era um we're going to do 300 P noes uh Max 3 per wallet by the way okay um in uh in in the Deep South era then we have the South era right with the fully working prototype um still no main net traffic or anything in the South era so we want to drive that up to maybe like a thousand okay and what will people be able to do though by the time we get there um still in devet I mean we're not talking about main net yet are people going to be able to actually build and leverage that storage layer for their apps oh yeah they can build um their apps already while we're on devet and they can test them out on devet and you know they're they're going to be working apps um and they do that in parallel until we launch on uh on mainnet with the Frankfurt release right um relatively early it's like I don't know the seventh or eth release eightth release that we that we do in general that's going to be out there in mainnet but you can build your apps in the South era um on devet because with the very first release of the South era the Munich release everything's there all the API that the that the apps are using right they have their their own instructions that they can send to the storage layer right so you can make a d first of all you create your your world that's a file system right that you use we call that instruction the Big Bang instruction right it creates your Universe right and and then you can do MK deer right that's create directories and then you can create files in there and then you can read and write from those files right read and write we found found those terms really boring so for us it's called Peak and poke right love it so with with the Poke instructions we write something to the file and with the peak we read it back um it's kind of a nod to my early years when we used the basic programming language right it had Peak and poke as well me I'm that old I remember okay so so we have that Peak and poke and we call it Peak poke Pro even right because there is that those Merkel proofs that I talked about that are being generated the um the son of validators being able to challenge those P noes um so to to kind of make verify those proofs um so it's Peak poke Pro and um and yeah at some point if someone wants to destroy their their whole file system and just close out the app and get get back everything they paid in order to set up that space we have an Armageddon instruction that destroys the world right wow all right um what is a Merkel proof for those that don't understand what those are yeah so that would probably be another another video or so the Merkel proof is basically you know cryptography is all about hash functions right so hash function functions are functions that take a piece of data and then create basically something like a check sum right so a check sum is something that's shorter than the original data but somehow the check sum didn't shouldn't be telling you what the original data was kind it's kind of unidirectional right it's easy to calculate this way to to um to to to create the hash and or the check some of some data but it's not easy having the hash to figure out what the original data was right and that's where all the math comes in what are good hash functions and stuff like that you know I envy these kind of mathematicians and out there and stuff and it's a lot of Israelis that did that stuff I mean back in the day it was the Germans that did it right and now now so don't want to get into history here but um all these these hash functions and then if you make hashes of hashes and stuff like that right then you can build a tree right it's called that Merkel tree so you have the data in the bottom and then you hash it and then out of these hashes then you have maybe like what 256 blocks of data you have 56 hashes then you hash these hashes together and then you're only at uh if if you take two of those then you're only at 128 and then one level above you're at 64 and then you have in the top what's called a Merkel rout right and that has some nice properties because if you change anything in the middle or so you just need to take that path through the through the tree and you don't have to do everything again and stuff like that so these proofs have these cryptographic properties right now that you explain that a little bit and this going to make it very easy for you to answer this question what happens if Bad actors get a hold of the data oh yeah so that's obviously uh something that's being taken care of on several levels um it's not that the zum storage layer per se is kind of encrypted it's going to be an optional um type of thing because it costs right and the salana accounts they are completely public right anyone can see anything on there we have that um optional encryption layer that we put on top of that and also you need to understand that all the data is chunked right and and we call that paged we we call these these chunks pages and that we borrowed that from Unix memory management right so it's called a page and in Unix it's I think 4 kilobytes or something ours will be a bit larger because obviously it's an exabyte system so a page is likely G to be a megabyte or something but then everything is stored on these it's like a tile right every tile is same size right and but the the data is all chunked into these pages so the P noes typically will not really know what files there uh they are storing right they just have pages and there's data in there and it's not like cons consecutive Pages or consecutive contents of a file or something like that they store it all redundantly and with that optional encryption layer on top of that you will not be able to figure out what's in that data and what happens if people get a hold of that data that depends on the app right with many apps it won't it won't be that critical right if we do the Wikipedia and people can read what's in there well that's kind of you actually want people to get data exactly what we're going for but there's other apps obviously where that would be super critical um so that's why we have that that optional um encryption layer in there yeah all right Sean what do you foresee people building using you know the zum platform here oh my gosh that can that can be a whole video in itself to be completely honest with you but let's let's go over what we mentioned already Wikipedia Uber you know maybe the next YouTube anything that can host that can store data intensive apps maybe a gaming type of browser based application something like that we want to build the infrastructure so that the creativity from the community and for everybody that's developing on web 3 can Thrive so unfortunately I'm not part of the app creativity team but man the sky is endless we have yeah we have a separate channel for that on our Discord by the way so sign up for our Discord and uh we're collecting ideas there one of the ideas that I find especially intriguing uh that I want to mention here is um Ai and and llms right we have all these these llms out there and with the Advent of um deep seek and stuff so we have llms out there and we don't know are they may be compromised yeah I mean the the first question is are they biased most of them are in some way or the other uh but the other way is they might even be with malicious intent being compromised by state actors and stuff like that right so how do we keep those llms in check right what we need there is those llms actually signing their responses that's one of the the big things that I'm fighting for and you know I'm going out to all these llm providers and tell them well if I use your API at least optionally I want to have your respons signed right cuz otherwise I have grock chat GPT you name it um Cloe all out there and just telling me something and I can never prove you know I can take a screenshot yeah and tweet it and say you Clau me this right but it it it can be doctor right there's no real verification nobody can tell right and and I think that won't stay that way I I I think all these llms if they want to survive there will be competitive pressure to at least optionally sign their responses so that I can prove this is what came out of chat GPT on that date on on this response yeah once we have that we can collect that we can send challenges to all these llms right and have a suite of Challenge questions like what happened on I forget that name in in Beijing that that was it tanman square or something like yeah so we ask that question deep sequel know what happened nothing happened there yeah yeah nothing happened so and there's there's a lot of other um you know what happened on 911 or you name it right and um and then store that in the zum storage layer have it administered by a DA right and and challenge all these llms I will be super excited for that but it won't work without those llms actually signing their responses yeah but I do love that um a lot of times is the the storage providers like the P Runners are going to be the ones that are going to be not calling the shots but um essentially providing their feedback saying hey I would love to see this I would love to see that um I will tell you that node Runners are your biggest fan base like if I run a node I want to tell the world that I'm running that node and I want to make sure that other people are doing the same um and talk about the the pressure with the llms right now we have already seen that right we see llms now explaining how they got to that that final answer they explain the thought process behind it they kind of walk you through it so like you're saying it's just a matter of time before you know the people actually expect that signature saying this is verified this is true um what can we do to get there yeah and I think you know AI safety is is still a big thing we don't want to kind of stifle AI innovation of course but somehow we need to make sure it's safe and um and having that in in a decentralized app with challenging all these that could be one of those apps oh yeah right so so much for your question what apps could be out there there there is you know and and gazillion types of apps and and it's really that's why I like that term of Cambrian explosion right it's like there will be so many apps that we can't even think of today and that was by the way the case in 2015 when when vitalic came up with the ethereum idea and obviously he was being asked like crazy you know what is this being used for right it sounded like a like a geeky type of thing that nobody really needs right and vitalic said well I don't know right it's just I I just put a general purpose World computer out there and let's see what people build right and he had a few examples like prediction markets and stuff that turned out to be true but you know it's such a universal tool yeah um same thing with AI by the way right what what what could it all be and then suddenly we had agents and we had that reasoning where they they give you their thought process and stuff like who would have thought that two years ago right it's like it's like we we don't really know right but we just put a really really versal tool out there that's enabling to do everything decentralized and and decentralization is a trend not for everything of course there's so many people that say well nobody needs decentralization but we do need it otherwise crypto wouldn't be there and we're at like what how many trillion market cap today uh a few trillions I believe and and that's all only because of decentralization because if it weren't for decentralization we wouldn't need all that crap right no absolutely and I think n Runners are the ones that really really love the idea of being self- Sovereign being able to actually own their data to be able to actually you know do things on their own without a third party telling them where where to go where they can't go um and really having control over their lives so um having the ability to actually have real storage on the blockchain is a game Cher for all of us absolutely well I really really want to know how we're going to get this done so stick around and we'll get another video out for you guys explaining exactly how these P noes are literally going to change the way blockchain is looked at
