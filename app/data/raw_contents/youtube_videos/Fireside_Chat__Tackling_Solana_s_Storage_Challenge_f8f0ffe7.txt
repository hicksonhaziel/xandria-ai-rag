TITLE: Fireside Chat: Tackling Solana’s Storage Challenges
================================================================================

we're here with blockchain Bernie and I want to talk salana because man you're like the salana Maxi almost from validators to even xandum now providing Storage Solutions on salana but salana is not always all that's cracked up to be because there it does have limitations talk to me about those yeah yeah and you know Solana's limitations is what prompted me to to build sandium right and you know every everything has its limitations and salana is great I and I love salana I've built apps on salana I've you know I've been number one like two three years ago number one on Solana's Stock Exchange by kudos for about for a few months or so right that's awesome you got a free ticket to breakpoint for that no they didn't quite give me that but anyway so sana's limitations first of all you know salana has a very opinionated Vision right right there is one guy behind it Anatolia yakovenko and he calls himself the co- a co-founder but in fact he is the founder and he's the the father of the of all those ideas on Solana and he has a very specific vision and the vision is he calls that a global State machine right and um and also the other part of the vision is blockchain at the speed of NASDAQ that was the title of his pitch deck and in in the very early days um so with these two things with with anatoli's vision you you can say okay that's what he's building right and he's laser focused on that he doesn't look left and right um that's fine and salana has two two types of limitations one within that realm that un wants to build right it is not the perfect Global State machine yet it is not the um blockchain at the speed of NASDAQ yet they are they keep improving it so there's limitations there but also that that's the limitations in kind of the vertical Direction but there's also limitations in the horizontal Direction where there's opportunities what salana could be besides that initial Vision right and so there are these these limitations in breadth and there are limitations in depth I see right so let's maybe start with with the limitations within the initial Vision right the global State machine and Global is quite important to him right there's things like Global price Discovery if you go on ethereum everything lives in l2s and the l2s are not Global they are just local to their own L2 they're kind of siloed type of things and and salana is breaking that it's it's fast enough to be just one L1 and you have that Global State machine and a global price Discovery and and Sal is doing great on that and the global state where is that Global State kept it is kept in what's called salana accounts salana accounts is the only place where people can store data on salana um they are super fast they don't they don't slow down the blockchain right with all those like I think currently we usually have around 4,000 uh transactions a second and what 2, 500 or so of those are vote transactions the rest is real payload so we have four figures payload transactions per second which is super fast and the accounts can keep up with that the the accounts are super fast that's because each and every SAA validator keeps those accounts basically in memory they canot afford to have them on disk in the valid at our Hardware because then they would be too slow but that also means that the salana accounts don't scale with regards to storage capacity right there's just natural limits there and um we've made that uh that calculation there with a little spreadsheet that we that we like to show and um if you want to store like one terabyte in salana accounts and one terabyte everyone understands that's just a mediumsized app it's a bare minimum nowadays for minimum right so for any app that's really successful and has millions of customers you would need way way more than one terabyte but even if it's one terabyte you want to store it on salana it's going to cost you1 billion doar right1 billion dollar in what they call rent right it's like it it's kind of a deposit that you have to put down to create that account of size one tbte there's a size limitation also I think it's 8 megabyte so you have to use a lot of accounts to get to that one terabyte uh but then you pay that billion dollars that that yeah that's just not feasible not scalable not well it's obviously not something that he is looking into taking care of but again with with great you know I say I would to say misalignments but with great limitations comes great opportunities as well right absolutely let me stick to you know because I see toally in front of my mind here now right and and with what we're building with xandum it is an expansion in in breadth right it's it's making salana into something that was not part of his initial Vision right his initial Vision was just the state machine and doing defi his vision is not to be able to create apps that have C customer databases and store a lot of data or something so granted right hey toally you didn't create it to to have a file system and and store exhibites or something that was not the original that's our vision that's xandi's Vision we're building that and we're extending salana on you know on the breadth um um Dimension but even within Solana's initial vision of being that Global State machine uh blockchain at this pet a NASDAQ storage already is a limitation because the more apps there are right even the apps that are being deployed right people are writing apps they deploy it up until you know two three months ago it was a real hassle to even deploy an app that's like a few hundred kilobytes maybe a few megabytes or so it was not going through and then you had to do like 30 different tries in to get it there they fix a good part of that it's way easier now um but yeah even with with that um it's becoming a problem that the accounts don't scale just because there are so many apps right and if if if we keep exploding like that on salana have way way more apps way way more users it's going to be way way more accounts and and it's going to become a problem even on on Solana's initial Vision without without making it into something that wasn't intended in the beginning it's going to be a problem and you see that also when operating a validator I'm operating a son validator right there is a concept called snapshots right and the snapshots are well a snapshot in time of all that Global state of all accounts that exist on Sal and you know they started out to be like uh you know a few hundred megabytes and a gigabyte and you know I remember the days maybe a year ago or so they were like 20 um 20 Gigabytes they are now like 95 gigabytes W and it's growing like crazy right once these things are a couple of hundred gigabytes they won't be manageable for validators anymore right and every time you install a new validator software you need to start from scratch so you need to get that that Snapshot from somewhere then the software needs to read through all that snapshot and build up all the storages and stuff like that so it is becoming apparent everywhere that scaling storage is a big big issue for salana right and sometimes I say xandum is a scaling solution for salana and we really are and then people say like well do we even need a scaling solution it's the fastest blockchain in the world right but fast is not everything right we also need storage capacity and scaling with that storage capacity that's a big big limitation um in Sona these days no I love that I mean essentially what you're saying is that you're not trying to replace the Lana you're trying to fit in the holes that might be missing the things that they might have overlooked that obviously we're going to need here in the not only short term but long term as well because the larger the these account sizes become the harder it is is going to be for all of these validators to be able to store it all and we're talking about 3,000 validators around the globe that are trying to do this all the time yeah yeah so how does xandum solve that problem yeah so we're we're adding a whole new tier of storage right there's the salana accounts which is kind of the tier one storage and we need that right we you know there's no need to replace the salic accounts or something they are like and I like that world computer met metaphor right and that came up basically in 2015 with the Advent of of ethereum and and vitalic butterin um created it and with with the Advent of ethereum blockchain became programmable yeah and suddenly we could run software on a blockchain rather than run software just on a computer that someone controls right um so suddenly we had a world computer that is real decentralized and nobody controls it right it's like it's like satoshi's vision of you know not having to play by the rules of some centralized guys but you know having the the community the world the users control everything he had it just for currency Satoshi and then vitalic came and did it for software right we could run software on ethereum uh starting from 2015 and then we have that world computer metaphor right but if you if we really think about world computer yeah we can run code on the blockchain that's the CPU part of the computer and we can we can store things in accounts that's the ram of the computer right it's the random access memory the the the the fast memory but we don't have that disc that each and every other computer has we have what's called also attached storage or direct attached storage Das and every computer has been having that for decades yeah um just the blockchain doesn't have it right so the the the world computer metaphor doesn't really hold for um for any blockchain for any smart contract platform that's out there and and we think that's badly needed to have all the breadth of applications that we have out there in in web to or in the world or in in in Enterprise it or something we can build any application that we can think of and storing large amounts of data and having databases and it's a is a big part of it and we just cannot do that on the blockchain and I went through that on my own when I built my first Sal app in 2022 called No store um where we had the first incarnation of of the xandum chain we thought we make our own blockchain we just used the sauna code right now we transitioned to do it all on salana but we built not store which was a non-trivial app and you know I I felt the limitations each and every day right like not being able to really store things in a file system manner just having to do everything in a accounts with all the limitations of the accounts and um all these type of things it is really really a limited programming model that's so much different from you know the the the hundreds of millions of programmers that we have on the world that that know the normal computer model right so getting the blockchain closer to that um showing developers that hey whatever you can build um on a normal client server architecture you can now build it on the blockchain as well finally finally yeah and and showing off our demo apps so one of our key demo apps will be a decentralized version of Wikipedia right and the Wikipedia database by the way is 250 gigabytes without the media just the Articles right and that's already a year old or so that number maybe it's like 300 now right oh and um and that's without the media so you wouldn't be able to do that on on any blockchain in in accounts right you would need a storage layer and you know why is it that the accounts don't scale it's because we always have a redundancy of 3,000 right everything I store will be stored on all 3,000 validators and you can tell that costs a lot of money and it it it puts a lid on on scalability yeah you and that's why you have this set of P noes the provider nodes that do the actual heavy lifting of storage and um and there the app can decide what's the redundancy that I need right some apps might just need three p noes storing their data right yeah which is okay giving that power back to the user is everything it sounds like yeah yeah now I'm excited about it I've told you that I'm going to run a node myself where can people go and find out more information about this stuff yeah our website it is xandum Network um and uh xandum network is the website of the xandum foundation uh which is part of the Dao and the Dao you know administers all that platform so go to xandum D Network subscribe to all our channels there the email list is important the Discord is important and our Discord is vibrant right so there's always people there we have uh moderators recruited from the community that help moderate it um I'm on there uh often and um and it's a it's the most interactive of all of all media out there and and X is also important right we're we're really keeping people up to dat on X both on on the xandum network X account and also on my blockchain Bernie X account and um and you know you can run a p note right so that's an opportunity out whether it's as early as in our devet whether it's later on testnet both of which are incentivized um but then starting with main net it's all permissionless anyone can just you know take our documentation run a p Noe um help secure the network help store the data of the world which by the way will be trust anchored right not only on salana but likely also on the likes of ethereum and maybe some others so we will just take certain snapshots C calculate these Merkel proofs that we talked about in in another video and logging them to several blockchains including um ethereum maybe including even Bitcoin or stuff like that so that we have a trust anchoring and can have that database of the world um you know completely blockchain grade trust anchored in different block chains so that we can make sure that this is the correct data and anchor to even several blockchains I love that Bernie thank you so much guys this is the time for you to get into this thing because we are talking about the next iteration of web 3 we're talking about empowering devs with you know the abilities that they've had in web 2 for so long can actually finally finally say that web 3 is ready for prime time once we get these P noes up and running so that people can build the you know the apps that they've wished to build for so long but have been able to so don't miss the opportunity of getting in this thing at the ground level
